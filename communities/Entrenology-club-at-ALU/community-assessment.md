Culture:
- We welcome new ideas but the idea has to be reviewed by the leaders of the group before validating it.
- No document clearly stating our policies and procedures exists.
- In case of a disagreement, the leaders of community must come to a compromise.
- Personnaly, I handle disagreements b organising a separate meeting for the leaders only, to talk about the problem and decide on
the best way forward.
