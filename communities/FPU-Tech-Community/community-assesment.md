#Assessing Your Community's Needs

##Definition
Florida Polytechnic University’s tech community. FPU is an all STEM university that was established in 2014. I want to focus on our students with technology focused majors and interests.

##Size
The current size of our community is around 100 students. Due to our University being only 2 years old we have around 1,300 students enrolled, all with technology focused majors. Being in an all STEM school I would like to expand the community to at least 15% of the school’s population, or 195 students. This means that I want to expand the community to about double its current population.
The funny thing is we have no history.
Since 2014, the size of this community has been increasing as the school’s population increases. This isn’t a natural growth because at the beginning of the school’s history, most of the students were freshman, then last year they were mostly freshman and sophomore, and so on. Therefore next year will be the first year there is a “full house” of students. This means that only after next year can the community begin to have a natural, or organic, growth. And around then I would like to shoot for 15% of the population again.

##Resources
Currently our school has few resources for people in our community to learn about tech. Occasionally, we will get guest speakers from industry to come and give free seminars and there are clubs that regularly give workshops. We struggle with obtaining the resources to produce the quantity and quality of workshops that we would like. Within our community there are only a hand full that are willing to give a workshop or feel qualified to teach others.

##Accessibility
Our school has a small population and that results in very personal relationships within the majority of our community. Ultimately this results in very easy accessibility to resources even between students and faculty. However, one of our biggest struggles is encouraging students to reach out to others to get the resources they are looking for.

##Interests
Something kind of unique about our community is that computer science majors are by far the major with the lowest participation. Even our Hackathon organizing team is entirely made up of Electrical, Mechanical and Computer Engineering Majors. We provide a pretty wide variety of workshops, from software to hardware to graphic design, but we would like more participation from computer science and other majors.

##Goals
Our main goal for our community is to bridge the gap between what we learn in class and creating. We’ve managed to maintain a group of passionate developers from all majors, but we would like to get more participation from freshman and computer science students.
Our current goals are to hold at least 3 workshops a semester, a Hack Day in the fall and our Hackathon (PolyHacks) in the spring. In addition to this, we hold club meetings at least twice a month to keep students involved and grow our community.

##Location
Our location has its advantaged and disadvantages. Currently our university has one academics building. As an all STEM school we also have no library and all of our literature is online. Therefore there is really only one building for all club activities to take place. This has its disadvantages because we have to wait until after the majority of classes are over to be able to reserve a room and having late meetings turns off commuters that have to drive home. The advantage is that everyone in the university can easily access the building and attend our meetings/events.
Another large advantage is that the venue is 100% free and we can accommodate to fit a large amount of people comfortably in a meeting. Also, parking is not really an issue because there is free parking a reasonable walking distance away from the building.

##Communication
Currently our main form of communication has been through an email group. However, this has proven to be quite limiting because we can only contact people who have already attended a meeting which makes it hard to reach out to others.
Some of our struggles have been keeping our social media up to date and communicating with freshman. We have a facebook group with a decent amount of members but we fail to update it regularly on meetings and events. Also, 46% of our school is currently made up of freshman and we do not have a decent way of communicating with them. This is something we hope to find a solution for in the near future.

##Culture
I would like to believe that our community is very welcoming. However, because we all have become so close, it may be turning off new members. This is like how you may be hesitant to join a new friend group because it seems like it is already established and you are unneeded. I think it is good that we are aware of this though and make an effort to personally walk up to new faces and introduce ourselves/make conversation.
