KMA hackers  - not really a name, but will do for now
 
 Needed Now: stable meetup schedule, existing community is little and rarely has something in common out of study events.


    -idea - Initiate event quotas (external/internal, fun/educational/challenges), start organizational group of people,
    start monthly meetings and have also some fun on schedule, not only lections , but dinners, quests and hardware workshops.


Needed ideally: promotion. The faculty is really awesome technically and not very big,
which helps to build long-term relationships among studs and teachers, but even within KMA university people 
have no idea about what FI students are studying and doing socially. When high schoolers decide where to go after graduation,
they rarely concider KMA FI, because they don`t know how cool it really is.


    -idea - Start online community and have a row of events for newbies in spring and fall, widely announced. 
    Take part officially in the biggest conferences and partner with the most established IT groups from other unis.


--Definition
KMA hackers - (after Kyiv-Mohyla academy) - can also transform into Key Men Around or Keeping Magic Available 
(no drugs, I mean.. we will have to work on it yet :) )


--Actual size is up to hundred, of whom maybe 25-35 are active and engaged. Others are mainly busy with their own work
or join communities of other unis.
I do not look to draw up quantity, rather quality, but increasing group activity must bring more people (like 80), 
and having a 10-20 alumnis with us would benefit serious projects and tech talks. 
Historically size was defined by FI faculty of KMA - being a rather small university, faculty of informatics has just three BA
programmes, if 7-8 of each specialization and year of study participates, we have roughly 100 members.


--Resources
On one hand learning process is empowered with tech companies, which give internship and tutorial projects for student teams,
and this is agreed, but not wholly organised by university community. And they are only available for KMA FI students,
due to their knowledge basis. Library and database are available. Resources for holding meetings limit to general open spaces
(two in university, could be busy) and study rooms, which are in teachers` responsibility. Friendly professor lets community
to have tech talks or do workshop in computer equipped room.
No hackathons were held, seminars are split with IT companies and other communities in university.
Online system of grading also gives access to some materials, but is limited.


--Accessibility


Every FI student is eligible to reach those resources, but other studs are not entering, lacking technical level 
(there`s a layer of events and support for starters and non-math people missing).
Meeting are mostly held at evenings, they are open but place is limited to uni rooms.
No special requests are considered as audience is very homogenous - just middle and senior CC students.  


--Interests
Right now it is not only made up only of computer science students, but also meetings are covering 
only very narrow technical topics.My research shows that people are not taking initiative but would participate
in themed workshops and quests or hackathons eagerly. 


--Goals
Being students, these members are heading toward degree and are aimed at most practical involvement. 
They get jobs at third year mostly, and would spare some time to activities which only bring some new experience -
like sharing or do some teambuilding, maybe some practical soft skills for employment also, but mostly brainy info. 
Literally it is community of nerds, which could change to geeks, if we start some area to actually communicate.
I personally want this group to become more open to students of other major (like my own, Sociology) by bridging them.


--Location
Offline meetings are initiated and supported with teachers, consequently held freely in equipped classrooms
(we have an option to use projector or whiteboard, seating is the same at all locations and not designed to serve comfort),
rarely in library - internet there is poor. Online communication is NOT organized (we should start with fb page,
but apparently not everyone is using it, so we think of having slack instead). 
University place is located near subway and there are shops and restaurants. 
Transport is not a problem up until midnight. We can host 20 - 80 people comfortably, 
for anything bigger it is better to ask coworking or tech company to host us (or bigger uni, they can fit 150 people OK).


--Communication
Word of mouth, board announcements, teachers are sharing at office hours (that`s what gonna be fixed at first).
We need a living channel, used by most people, able to transmit info both ways - 
reminders and propositions to memebers + feedback from them.


--Culture
University policy is mostly concerning ukrainian and english language, intellectual property,
no-abuse and no-bribe rules. No special code of conduct is needed. 
People are not entering if they are not enrolled FI students, so there are no quarrels now,
but if we change openness to invite everyone keen and interested, not only faculty members, 
we have to design rules and even levels of involvement. I always follow no-asshole rule, and if we face any disagreement 
it should be decided quite, between opponents, me as organizer or Andrew Hlybovets( PhD and trusted by everyone person) 
acting as mediators.
