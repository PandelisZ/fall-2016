### Definition

Doubtful CS students who need reassuring and support.

### Size
Montclair State University currently has 16,336 undergraduates with around a couple thousand being CS majors. MSU is known more for its liberal arts as its dance program is in the top 5 in the nation. cPersonally, I interact and meet many CS and STEM majors in chance encounters because there really is no “to-go” community event in my school. 

### Resources
Currently there are STEM field related career/major fairs and departmental resources like flyers, office hours, and online boards.

### Accessibility
Out of the resources we actually have, they are quite accessible. Montclair State University prides itself on being handicap and disability friendly.  Ranging from handicap buses that transport you around campus to almost all doors being automated.

### Interests
My community is mainly made of liberal arts oriented students and out of the CS students within it, they are mainly open to all topics.

### Goals
I want to create a hackathon for our school to highlight our schools technical aspect and a financially stable and fun hack nights to promote students to develop cool projects with other talented coders! 

### Location
We currently meet on Montclair State University campus, either in conference rooms or open lounges - depends on outside schedules. Parking at MSU is literal hell so most of the students attending these gatherings live on campus. Cost is free but planning is usually months in advance due to school’s lack of response. Normally, only a couple of students attend the meetings so there’s tons of space if it were ever needed. We don’t supply snack or drinks regularly so vending machines near by are the only source of snacks/beverages.

### Communication
The only form of communication our tech community has is during face to face club meetings. The official Computer Science club we have is currently not active due to new school regulations. We could definitely benefit from other ways of communication. I’m interested in getting my community an official Facebook group or maybe a Slack channel to get everyone talking to each other. 

### Culture
The only real issue my community has trouble with is getting over the initial disagreement over regulations and policies from the school itself. It’s difficult and troublesome to continue facing these roadblocks when you’re trying to create opportunities and events in your community.
