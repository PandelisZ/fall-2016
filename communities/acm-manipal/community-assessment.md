## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you'be completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
ACM Manipal -- our university's ACM chapter

### Size
We have about ~35 core committee members who're directly responsible for running the club.

### Resources
We currently organise events, technical workshops throughout the semester. During breaks, we try to fit in a few online sessions on a technical topic. We also started a mentorship program for people new to CS by pairing them up with someone more experienced. Microsoft conducts a 24-hour annual hackathon called Code.Fun.Do. 

### Accessibility
My community is located in a place which can be best described as a college town. Hence, most people involved in any activity are students of my college itself. We normally organise events after classes when everyone ins

### Interests
The community is made up primarily of people from CS and IT branches. However, there are a few students from Mechanical and Electrical as well. We do not exclude anyone based on their branch.
There is a lot of focus on competitive programming in my college and very little on software development, research, etc. The whole goal of starting this ACM chapter is to broaden the perspective of how most people perceive CS and its extent. 

### Goals
People primarily get involved with this community to grow and advance their technical skills. Most of them do it to bag a good job, yes, a few people are really passionate about developing as well.
Right now, I really want to focus on involvement with open source as a way of acquiring real world software development skills as none of this is a part of the average college curriculum.


### Location
It's primarily in-person group. Our college provides us classrooms for meetings, events, etc for free. They're equipped with chairs, desks, a blackboard and projector. There are open spaces within a reach as well. Since most of our gatherings happen on campus and are attended by students, we do not need transportation. Water is available nearby but snacks aren't provided.

### Communication
Our primary means of communication for the committee members is a WhatsApp group. We tried using Slack, but it was very difficult to get people there to discuss anything, hence we had to discontinue its use. We also have a Facebook group which we use for polls, long form discussions, etc. We communicate with other students from our college by means of mail and a Facebook page.

### Culture
Our community is very welcoming to new people! We encourage everyone who wants to learn about CS to join us. Our goal is to a have an inclusive, safe environment for everyone who wants to be a part of our community. We also have a Code of Conduct in place to ensure the same. In case of a disagreement, we try to iron it by listening to all the parties involved and making the decision which is in the best interests of our community and all the people involved. We encourage everyone to chip in irrespective of what year or branch they belong to.
