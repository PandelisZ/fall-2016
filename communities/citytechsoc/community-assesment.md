### Definition
Currently:
- A collective of primarily technical students at City, University of London who are passionate about technology and want to do things with for the sake of personal development.

Ideally:
- A larger collective of students at City, from a range of backgrounds who are passionate about technology and want to do things with it.

Improvements:
- There has been interest from non technical students in learning to program. It would be nice to accommodate for them and create an environment where students exchange varying skill sets. Getting more students familiar with hardware, such as Electrical Engineering students involved.
