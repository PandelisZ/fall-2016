## Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Definition
Currently:
- A collective of primarily technical students at City, University of London who are passionate about technology and want to do things with for the sake of personal development.

Ideally:
- A larger collective of students at City, from a range of backgrounds who are passionate about technology and want to apply it to different ideas, with an emphasis on personal development.
- Theres a very strong entrepreneurial community among students at the university, which is spearheaded by [CityVentures](http://www.city.ac.uk/cityventures), part of the enterprise division of the university. But after having gone to almost every event of theirs in my first year, I realised there was close to zero technical students taking part in this community. It would be great to see more technical students integrating into it and taking advantage.

Improvements:
- There has been interest from non technical students in learning to program. It would be nice to accommodate for them and create an environment where students exchange varying skill sets.
- Getting more students that are familiar with hardware - such as Electrical Engineering students, involved in the tech community.

### Size
Currently:
- The society was formally started in September 2016, and we have just over 100 students who are signed up onto the society's Slack account.
- However, about 30 - 40 have actively participated in the events that we have hosted thus far.

Ideally:
- It would be great if at the very least, all of the students who have previously expressed interested actively partook in the events that we hold, but preferably if most technical students at the university joined in the activities.
- It would be even better if students of other backgrounds, such as maths, business, etc attended the events, so as to create a multidisciplinary community where a strong interest in technology and it's applications is the driving factor.

Historically:
- There wasn't much of a technology community before-hand, at least nothing publicly advertised. It was the main reason we started City Tech - there was a need for a tech community on campus that wasn't being fulfilled.
- From conversations with departmental academics, there was a similar initiative a few years ago that did not outlast the students who started it.

### Resources
Currently:
- We've often referred students to online courses such as codecademy, Udacity, Udemy, Coursera and the likes. We've also set up a Slack group, with specific channels for help with specific topics, such as git-help and gamedev channels, and a learning channel for general questions.
- We've run an Intro to Git workshop and have other workshops planned, as well as drop in sessions for Java.
- We're trying to push the students to go to upcoming hackathons at other universities as well as hosting our own: MLH Local Hack Day, Global Game Jam and Hack City. We try to make good use of the events run by the Hackathon Hackers EU community by advertising them internally.

### Accessibility
Currently:
- Resources are quite accessible to students who tend to engage well.
- It seems like the students who currently attend our events are those that may have already had some experience with development.
- We tend to hold events after 5pm, since that's when most students will have finished lectures/tutorials by. However, it may be too late in the day for some, so theres always this constant trade-off.

Ideally:
- It would be great to have a way of reaching out to beginners, and breaking the initial barriers to learning, as most of the community will just be getting into the technology field. We've run events and use Slack to overcome this which has helped, but I think there may also be other ways.
- Figuring out a way of determining when the best time for events would be for everyone, without leaving people out.
- We should also be doing more to cater to people with disabilities.

### Interests
Currently:
- Students who have attend events so far (since September) have been wholly Computer Science students, despite there having been interest (such as during Freshers Week) from non CS students.

Ideally:
- There was a lot of interest from non CS students wanting to learn to program from scratch for personal reasons, as well as academic reasons (some Maths students wanted help with VB.NET for example). It would be great to have some technical events that are tailored to beginners from any discipline, rather than assuming any technical literacy at all.

Given the age of the community, there is a sense of ambiguity as to what topics students would be open to. Maybe a better job needs to be done to capture individual interests.

### Goals
Based on the events we've held, he primary reason students get involved seems to be to develop as a technical individual: to learn things they don't yet know.
- This seems like it's primarily driven by wanting to do well at university as well as find jobs.

Some of the goals/activities we've thought of setting have been introductions to different technologies and tech related items: Intro to Git, Intro to iOS dev, MLH Local Hack Day for students who may be intimidated by (new to) hackathons.

The community is young so we're still understanding it's goals and needs.

### Location
- We have a Slack group which all students who are interested in the tech society are added to. We use this as a place to ask questions, have discussions, announce upcoming (internal/external) hackathons and events.
- Our events (mainly workshops) have so far been hosted at the university.
- We've also advertised events not run by us, such as the Dinner hosted by Bloomberg and Hacktoberfest LDN, where some members have turned up.
- The university is generally in a very good location for technology related events, being a short work from Old Street (Silicon Roundabout) and Angel.
- We have a newly renovated open space at the university built specifically for CS students, that can fit 60-70 people. As a new society, we've also been recently granted access to book classrooms and lecture theatres for events, providing they're available.
- Theres limited access to parking nearby, but good access to public transportation.

### Communication
- We use Slack as our primary means of enabling the community to reach each other. We also have public Twitter and Facebook pages, as well as an internal Facebook group.
- We also send out a weekly email of events coming up that week: events that we're running as well as other interesting tech related events worth going to.

### Culture
- The community is new and still developing it's culture. But so far, it has been very welcoming of new people - given almost everyone is new. We're trying to create a culture where students can ask any questions and be open about what they don't understand.
- We take on board new ideas since we believe the events that we plan should be driven by what the community wants and is interested in.
- There are formal policies in place with regards to the society as being a part of the university's Student Union.
- Personally, I think both sides of any disputes should be heard before trying to cater to whatever each party feels needs to be improved.
