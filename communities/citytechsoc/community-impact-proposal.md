### Summary of Community’s needs

-	Community demographics: There are nearly 200 students who have signed up to our weekly mailing list and showed some form of interest in the society’s activities. But only about 20 students actively participate in events that we host and refer them to. The members are majority Computer Science students.
-	Communication: We use Slack as our primary means of enabling the community to reach each other, but it’s proving difficult to keep people on there since it’s another app to use. So we’re exploring using Facebook more. We also send out weekly emails of upcoming events and interesting resources.
-	Culture: The culture is still new and developing, but we aim to keep it as open and flexible as possible, given a lot of the students haven’t been exposed to the content we provide so there are naturally questions students have that we want them to be able to ask. We try to provide events and content based on the interests of the community members to some extent

### Proposal

The primary project I had planned to do as part of the Campus Experts programme was to organise the Local Hack Day as a way for students within City’s community to get an introductory taste of what a Hackathon is and why they should value them.

-	Timing: The date for Local Hack Day coincided nicely with Week 6 of the programme which was well timed.
-	Community demographics: We wanted to market the event to as many different people as possible to see who would be interested in a hack day. We used our usual social media accounts but we also put up posters all over campus, no just within the technical departments. We ended up getting not just CS students, but also structural engineering, sociology and math students who really enjoyed the event.
-	Goals: Some of the goals I identified as part of the Community Assessment were having introductions to different technical related items such as Git, as well as introducing hackathons to students who’ve never been. I think this was the right project to achieve those goals, since there a some workshops and the event taught the attendees that hackathons are primarily a place of learning, as opposed to competing.
-	Communication: We continued to use Slack as a way of communicating leading up to the event, during and afterwards, so students could share what they had done.

### Proposal Impact

Target Audience: The target audience of the Local Hack Day is current community members who have never been to a hackathon and want to understand what it is without investing too much (such as travel and overnight stays).
Community needs: The specific issue that I was addressing was the misunderstanding of hackathons and their purpose.
Resources: The main resource was a venue, some swag and food. We managed to book a good-sized common room on campus, and MLH and GitHub provided pretty cool swag (thanks!). We also managed to get the Department of Computer Science to cover the cost of the food. The Campus Experts talk on Git also proved to be very useful for my workshop on how to use Git and GitHub.
Media: To prepare for the impact project, I spent time practicing the delivery of my Git workshop, as well as delegating some of the workshops to other great members of the team.
Content Knowledge: Since I was primarily managing the overall day as well as delivering the Git workshop, I spent time going through the best practical ways to teach Git. The resources pointed to by the Campus Experts speakers proved to be useful.
Timeline: The Local Hack Day itself was a single day of course. I had planned for my Git workshop to be 45 minutes long, but it ended up running over an hour since I got some interesting and very welcome questions. But a lot of the other plans I’ve made will require a longer time frame, such as ongoing meetups, workshops and hackathons.

### Planning for the future

There were other initiatives that I had planned on the Experts programme that would be implemented the following term:

-	Continuing and diversifying the content of the weekly emails that we sent to our members.
-	Sending out a questionnaire in the new year to get a better understanding of what the community wanted to get out of the events we held, the type of events that we ran, as well as to get a better understanding of how the community’s demographic may have changed over the last few months.
-	Hosting the Global Game Jam, since there is a strong interest in game development among CS with Games Technology students.
-	More frequent events where the community can congregate and talk/share.
-	HackCity

I plan to iterate on my community plans every 3-4 weeks based on feedback that we get from our community members.
