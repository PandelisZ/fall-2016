# Concordia University

### Definition
- Any student at Concordia University interested in technology. These students want to discuss and share topics related to technology and who would like to improve their skills.

### Size
- The current size shall be the members of the HackConcordia Facebook page, 1233 members. However, only a handful of members are active on the page.
- An objective would be to double this number by the end of the school year.
- The group started from 0 members in late 2014.

### Resources
- The resources available to people in the community are average. The community is provided with articles from the tech community at large (outside of HackConcordia) about new and relevant topics in tech.
- Utilizing the GitHub organization page to provide online tutorials, articles, and much more is an objective.
- Without a permanent space, the community is unable to hold office hours and therefore communicates mainly through online messaging (e-mails, Facebook chat, Facebook group, etc.)
- ConUHacks, the annual Concordia hackathon, is hosted in January for students to come together and collaborate on projects.

### Accessibility
- Providing accessibilities to those who may not check Facebook frequently would be an objective i.e. uncovering new means of communication to reach as many members of the community in one place (whether it be through Slack or some form of online communication service).
- Providing accessibility for people with disabilities is an objective (ensure website, tutorials, etc. when being created are mindful of those with disabilities)  

### Interests
- The community consists mainly of computer science and engineering students. There exists non-computer science and engineering students, however this number is very small. The community _may_ be interested in other topics, however with limited time and ressources it is difficult to consider.  

### Goals
- Members get involved in the community, because they are interested in collaborating to learn and compete in hackathons.
- These members are interested in improving their skills and securing internships + fulltime jobs.
- A main goal would be to utilize the GitHub organization page to provide a hub for collaborating on open-source projects with other students. Their objective would be to grow their skills, give back to the community, create useful  systems, and build their CV.
- In addition to the main goal, ensuring the community is open and welcoming to all participants must be maintained at all times.

### Location
- The community is currently based solely online through a Facebook group (there does exist a website).
- Establishing a hacker space on campus is nearly impossible as the University is located in the city with space being expensive and limited.

### Communication
- The community communicates almost 100% through the Facebook group. There is a newsletter that gets used at most once a month.
- There exists a Twitter account that is currently not active.
- Finding other means of communications would be great to be able to expand and grow the community.

### Culture
- The community is welcoming to new people, however it is only encouraged to share tech related items.
- A policy or procedure would need to be established and documented to be able to handle arising disagreements.
