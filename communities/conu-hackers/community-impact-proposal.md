## Summary of the Community's Needs

**The Who**
Through the community assessment, the community size is determined to be the size of the [HackConcordia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackconcordia/) Facebook group, which is currently 1,278 members. The group is open to any student at Concordia University who interested in technology. These students want to discuss a66nd share topics related to technology, they want to improve their skills, get experience with hands-on projects, and to land internships, part-time, and full-time positions. The group primarily targets students who are interested in going beyond what is taught in the classroom.

The community interacts through the Facebook group. With the use of http://sociograph.io/, we are able to see that in the past month there have been 32 posts, from 19 different authors, with a combined total of 24 comments and 149 likes.

## Your Proposal

The beginning of an open source initiative.

Plan of attack : The launch of this initiative will begin with a "Hack week" in January. This will take place a week before ConUHacks II, happening January 21-22, 2017.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: increasing the size of the community, identify ways you are planning on accomplishing that. Explain how your efforts might help you create a more diverse community.
- **Goals**: You identified the goals of your community assessment. Include a summary of those goals and how your proposal addresses those goals.
- **Communication**: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community will be able to stay in-contact. This includes in-person meetings, webinars, and chat/forum platforms.


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
  - How will you obtain those resources?   
- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  - If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation.

## Planning for the Future

think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program

- When will you review the impact of your proposal? Will re-asses every month for the first 3 months. At which point, a new interval for reviewing will be set.
- How will you measure success? Although it is important to reach as many students as possible, we must have a way to measure the impact the content is for the students.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
