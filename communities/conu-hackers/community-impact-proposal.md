## Summary of the Community's Needs

Through the community assessment, the community size is determined to be the size of the [HackConcordia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackconcordia/) Facebook group, which is currently 1,283 members (compared to 1,233 members at the beginning of the campus experts program). The group is open to any student at Concordia University who interested in technology. These students want to discuss and share topics related to technology, they want to improve their skills, get experience with hands-on projects, and to land internships, part-time, and full-time positions. The group primarily targets students who are interested in going beyond what is taught in the classroom.

The community interacts through the Facebook group. With the use of http://sociograph.io/, at this current time we are able to see that in the past month there have been 32 posts, from 19 different authors, with a combined total of 24 comments and 149 likes.

## The Proposal

The beginning of an open source initiative at Concordia University.

**Plan of attack**: The launch of this initiative will begin with a "Hack Week" in January from the 16th to the 19th. This will take place a week before HackConcordia's annual hackathon, ConUHacks II, happening January 21-22, 2017.

Hack Week will be a week of tutorials hosted on campus and uploaded online to provide students with resources to leverage skills for the hackathon. Students will gain confidence and be equipped for their (potentially first) hackathon project. By lowering the barrier of entry for students through these workshops, we anticipate to have more projects submitted during the hackathon and foster a community of students with the desire to learn, to share, and to help one another. In addition, this initiative will also increase participation in the upcoming external hackathons across North America. Overall, we hope to conquer and eliminate the obstacles students face when wanting to contribute to open source projects.

The first step will be to create a Free GitHub Organization page as post some content. This content should include at a minimum the following:
- An about section
- How to get involved
- Learning resources (external)
- Workshops/tutorials created by Concordia students (minimum the ones for Hack Week)
- Code of Conduct

For now communication will remain on the Facebook page. A Slack group will be considered once the group reaches a certain number of members and a consistent level of participation is present.

- Success will be measured based on the contributions to the GitHub organization page as well as the number of participants to external hackathons.
