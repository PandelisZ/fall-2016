### Definition

Students interested in tech from the Dortmund campus.

### Size

### Resources

A hacker space.
We organize a hackathon once a year (DO!Hack) and Local Hack Day.

### Accessibility
TODO
Resources are hard to get (different schools, different systems and no cooperation between students from both schools)

### Interests
Community is made up only of computer science students and some people in it seem to like that.
I'd love to open the community for people from other disciplines: economics students, computer engineering students etc.

TODO

### Goals
They are students hoping to get a degree. Most of them don't work during semester.
It seems like they are trying to get in touch with companies, that are located around the campus (lots of startups but also already established mid-sized companies). These companies also have trouble reaching out to students.
Some of them are passionate about developing, others seem to be very passionate about one particular technology and one particular use of it.

Goals: set up monthly meetups with tech talks from students (so the students can get into public speaking) and with speakers from local companies.

### Location
Currently online-only.
Next step will be to setup monthly meetups on the campus (lots of parking space, good access with public transportation).
No water or snacks nearby, except for the automats in another building.

### Communication
Whatsapp.
Other means of communication could be beneficial.

### Culture
Very skeptical of new ideas.
No policies nor procedures.
