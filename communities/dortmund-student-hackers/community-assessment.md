### Definition

Students interested in tech at the Dortmund campus.

### Size
The community right now consists of 10 people.
FH Dortmund ca. 12k students, TU Dortmund ca 30k students. Few thousand CS students + other related disciplines, so the goal till the end of the year would be to atleast double the number of people in the community.

### Resources
A hacker space.
We organize a hackathon once a year (DO!Hack) and Local Hack Day. 
I'm thinking about talking to local companies, if they would be interested in slots for speakers.

### Accessibility
Resources are hard to get (different schools, different systems and no cooperation between students from both schools)

### Interests
STEM-heavy schools

### Goals
They are students hoping to get a degree. Most of them don't work during semester.
It seems like they are trying to get in touch with companies, that are located around the campus (lots of startups but also already established mid-sized companies). These companies also have trouble reaching out to students.
Some of them are passionate about developing, others seem to be very passionate about one particular technology and one particular use of it.

Goals: set up monthly meetups with tech talks from students (so the students can get into public speaking) and with speakers from local companies.
Each meetup would consist of 2-3 lighting talks (max. 10minutes each) and a talk by a speaker guest (up to 35 minutes). 

### Location
Dortmund Campus, lot's of rooms, that can be used by students for free.
No water or snacks nearby, except for the automats in another building.

### Communication
Whatsapp.
Other means of communication could be beneficial.

### Culture
Not sure how it really is.
