## Summary of the Community's Needs

/**
Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: Include data gathered from your community assessment like: the size of the community that you are targeting with your proposal, the educational background of your community, and the resources they currently have at their disposal and how accessible they are to the community.
- **Communication**: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community prefers to communicate.
- **Culture**: Summarize the existing culture within the community you are working with.

## Your Proposal

Lighting talks, 1-2 hours per month, Once a month on tuesday.
Each person has 5-10 minutes to present a topic (something that they're interested in, they work on or just think is interesting for attendees).
The community will stay in touch using Slack and Facebook groups and info about new meetups will be posted on meetup.com.


## Your Proposal's Impact

Target audience: students from the field of STEM.
Community needs: introducing students to public speaking, finding people interested in various topics.
Resources: a room (students at my school can book rooms for free :)! ), posters and stickers for promoting the meetups (can get them very cheaply, so I'm gonna foot the bill).
Media: finding speakers on campus (posters, talking to people), using social media to stay in touch with speakers/attendees.

Content knowledge:

Timeline: On december 13th we gonna meetup for lighting talks for the very first time. After that the talks will be organized on second tuesday of each month.

## Planning for the Future

Success will be measured mostly by the number of speakers every month. The more we get, the more topics will be presented, the more people will be interested in attending.
Between each meetup there will be 1 month, so that it will be possible to implement changes and think them through.
