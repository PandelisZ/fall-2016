#Assessing Your Community's Needs

##Definition

CompSoc (the University of Edinburgh Computing and AI Society) members and other participants in CompSoc activities.

##Size

 - 318 people on mailing list 2016/2017
 - 151 paid members 2016/2017 so far
 - 1048 CompSoc Facebook group members

We'd love ideally as many members as wanted to join - a larger size justifies expanding committee which allows more dedicated people to particular subjects and so more diversity and depth. However this could increase the workload of the “Executive Committee” having to manage more people and the club could get too large for future executive committees to guarantee availability for workload levels.

The group has varied in size historically, the current CompSoc being more or less a descendent from [LOLsoc](https://lolsoc.wordpress.com/) in 2008. The Facebook group is cumulative since it started and only removes spamming/abusive members, and membership levels have been around similar sizes the last few years I believe but need to find the numbers to verify this. There are a lot of members who follow through the Facebook group but never get around to signing up in an official manner (mailing list of paid membership).

##Resources

Every month October to March there is “Student Tech Meet Ups” (STMUs) that last a couple of hours whereby 2 to 4 talks are given by invited guests, and then other workshops and talks given, varying in quantity and content, depending on what is organised by each year's committee and club sponsors. HackSIG is hoping to run a dedicated workshop day for complete beginners to get them into starting coding and other hacking skills.

CompSoc has a strong established network of contacts in the tech industry from several years of sponsorship and the networking efforts of members. Additionally, the University School of Informatics is 1st in the UK for research excellence, and top 20 in the world, and so has many fantastic members of staff and resources, although most are not strictly accessible to undergraduates.

##Accessibility

**How accessible are the current resources in your community?**

Varying dependent on the activity and venue in question.

**Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?**

STMUs are Wednesdays once a month, which is when many sports clubs will be running events, and start at 6:30pm, which is only 30 minutes after the last timetabled University courses have finished which can make it difficult for members from the Science and Engineering campus (King's Buildings) to attend unless they make the very overcrowded last shuttle bus, but theoretically is after working hours. Free pizza is provided, justifying the timing clash with dinner time, but only if you get enough pizza before it runs out although if committee are aware of anyone missing out who was dependent on it for a meal, there have been occasions when more or compensatory food has been ordered for them. The committee ask for any members planning to attend with specific dietary requirements to get in touch and specific pizza orders are ordered and committee oversee it being available to the relevant member(s), but generally otherwise just half of the pizzas are vegan and vegetarian by default. 

**Is there childcare available?**

No, although under 18s are allowed to attend, so children could be brought but I do not think they would enjoy being made to sit through the talks.

**Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?**

The STMUs are normally held in the Informatics Forum building ground floor which has mobility access, as collapsible chairs are used, space can easily be rearranged if necessary to accommodate for a wheelchair or other physical support, AV equipment is used to ensure that hearing aids are able to tune in, there is no additional support for visually impaired beyond standard braille lettering on signage.

If other venues are used, there are currently no checks in place to ensure that they support accessibility for disabilities.


##Interests

CompSoc is officially registered as an “academic society” for “Computing and AI” but as the fields of research and applications of computing and AI are often multidisciplinary, related topics such as the linguistics where it relates to Natural Language Processing can be supported, discussed. It currently made of primarily Computer Science students and I am not happy with this as it is primarily due I believe to lack of awareness of CompSoc and its activities amongst other schools on campus.

The Edinburgh University Student Association (EUSA) who oversee clubs and societies at the University have a policy of not allowing the creation of societies with overlapping interests without explicit permission of the existing society and so CompSoc is made aware of the attempts. If there is sufficient interest within a EUSA society for a subset of the topics covered to be explored in more depth but insufficient substance or too much overlap for an independent society then a “Special Interest Group” (SIG) can be created. 

Therefore the boundaries of the topics covered by CompSoc have been discussed recently as there have however been conflicts over the last couple of years whereby new societies have been created, or attempts made to create them, in overlapping interests. Equally, CompSoc has to respect the boundaries of other existing societies, either by collaboration or avoidance. I found several other EUSA societies, other non-EUSA clubs, and we have 3 SIGs at the moment. (See the Other Info section for more details)

##Goals

EUSA allows up to 40% membership from non-current-University of Edinburgh students, which means members both from other universities (we have a large number of members from Edinburgh Napier), alumni (a few members), and non-students (a few young, early career members from the local tech scene). So we have mostly students, and members join to learn beyond their course, for networking for possible jobs and careers, and for socialising. We have had complaints over the last couple of years that CompSoc has become "too corporate" and acting more as advertisements for companies recruiting than acting in students' interests, suggesting that there is bit too much emphasis placed on that. This year's committee promised to reduce that aspect of the culture this year although how to implement that, especially as the events are nearly all financed through sponsorship in return for recruitment advertising, is uncertain.

As HackSec I have personally set HackSIG's goals for this academic year as:

**1.	To create a sustainable legacy of HackSIG that will ensure CompSoc is able to support and develop members’ involvement in the hackathon community.**
a.	Creating relevant documentation so as to inform and guide future HackSIG members and any other interested parties.
b.	Clearly defining roles, commitments, and timescales for volunteers for all HackSIG activities so as to minimise the chance of overworking, burnout, and unnecessary stress.
c.	Establishing connections and developing a strong supporting network for HackSIG for venues, catering, transport, and other logistics, such that future HackSIGs may use them with a lesser workload where possible.
d.	Investigating and implementing any tools that may make the work of future HackSIG’s easier.
e.	Investigating and implementing structures that allow for flexibility and accommodation of possible failures of future HackSIG’s. For example anything that would minimise disruption of HackSIG activities in the event of a President’s sudden and unexpected departure (I don’t plan to leave but I could get involved in a random traffic accident when travelling between hackathons, you never know!).

**2.	To increase the diversity of CompSoc activities where they relate to hackathons and other HackSIG involvement.**
a.	Actively recruit members from disciplines beyond the School of Informatics to participate in HackSIG activities.
b.	Provide increased support for under 18s and vulnerable adults to participate in HackSIG and HackSIG related activities.
c.	Investigate, document, and implement (where appropriate) methods of widening sexual, racial, religious, and gender diversity. This includes documenting unsuccessful methods where identified.
d.	Actively increase beginner participation in HackSIG activities.

##Location

The School of Informatics Computing labs, the Informatics Forum, and other University and sponsor-provided venues are used for events.

**Informatics Forum** - The venue of the STMUs, wonderfully accessible all round for the duration that it is booked by CompSoc, closed to undergraduates outside of that time. Very flexible large space with stacking chairs and collapsible tables that can be moved around, range of AV equipment for presentations, and power supplies if the tables are wanted for working. Car parking spaces and drop-off/pick-up space immediately outside front door. 

**The School of Informatics Computing labs (Forest Hill or Appleton Tower buildings)** - Forest Hill has lots of computing labs, and one large one, but none of the space is technically possible to book and is all for School of Informatics students only (I still don't have access to the building as a committee member of CompSoc) out of University teaching hours, although public during them. It is only around the corner from the Informatics Forum, so is still accessible by transport. The limited accessibility has caused issues in previous events because the labs themselves are not ground floor and so a person needs to be available at all times to enable non-Informatics students access in for any evening or weekend events. Appleton Tower is currently under refurbishment.

The School of Informatics is for various historical reasons located on the humanties and arts Central camps of the University in the city centre Old Town, whereas the rest of the College of Science and Engineering is located to the South of city in King's Buildings (about 40 minute uphill walk away, or 20 minutes by bus). Most undergraduate students live near and around Central campus regardless of study because of socials and so are very familiar with it, whereas most Informatics students have never seen King's Buildings.

##Communication

Currently we have:
 
 - **Facebook groups** - Primarily "CompSoc Members", there are also sub groups of CompSoc Members Opportunities, one for committee and there will soon be one for hackathon info specifically. The separate one for hackathons is proposed to allow more frequent and dedicated posts about hackathons that are relevant to CompSoc members, and with the aim of trying to create a better space for members to identify who is going to different hackathons and the levels of interest in them, to try and arrange better support from CompSoc for members to attend accordingly. 
 
 - **IRC** - I don't use but is surprisingly popular amongst the handful who do - I'll be trying to get an estimate of the number of active CompSoc IRC users soon! Committee does not officially use it for announcements of communication, it is primarily a space for members to members. Can be a bit cliquey for members feeling left out of the loop because they are intimidated by the tech/format of IRC. This isn't wanted or intended by the active users though, and a few have made several attempts over the last few years to create friendlier interfaces for IRC specifically to support CompSoc members, or to offer unofficial, informal guided introductions to using it. Used a lot to interact with Tardis group who are very active.
 
 - [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/compsoc) - Any commitee member can use the official Twitter account, and all are emailed interaction notifications for it, but without a dedicated member working on it, mentions can sometimes go unresponded. It isn't consistently used to post about CompSoc activities as it is dependent on who is available and willing and remembers to do so per activity.
 
 - **Emails** - Each member of the committee has an address at CompSoc which members can use to get in touch, or the all commmittee address. We have a mailing list of all current members that a newsletter is sporadically sent to.


##Culture

**How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?**

Theoretically, very welcoming - all descriptions ever made of CompSoc reference its ideals of openness but in practice, I'm unsure. Certainly no real tensions or conflict exists or pervades the society but the committee and certain groups are often seen (based on my informal chats to people) as very cliquey, often requiring frequent CompSoc event attendance to get "in the loop" of in-jokes and references. Additionally the influx of requests from EUSA of students wanting to form independent societies in CompSoc interests BEFORE contacting CompSoc themselves to request activities or topics, suggest a lack of approachability if it is considered easier or more relevant to consider starting a whole society before talking to committee. However this could vary committee to committee, and could also be a lack of information and awareness about how to contact or request - there isn't any formal procedure for it currently? 

**What happens if there is a disagreement? Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?**

Yes, there are official EUSA guidelines and policies that are documented however, they are only made accessible to the “Executive Committee” (President, Treasurer, and Secretary) through the University’s documentation system normally for courses (known as LEARN, a version of the proprietary Blackboard software). I assume but could not confirm that if requested it would be made accessible to other individuals. I believe the guidelines focus on the hierarchy of responsibility and communication in the event of conflict but as I was unable at the time of writing to find a copy myself, I cannot detail further.

**How will you personally handle it?**

If I am relevant to the conflict then I have had conflict training through the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology) and have had a lot of experience in personal and professional situations that give me confidence to address conflict effectively, adapting my approach to the individual situation.


##Other Info

So I basically found when researching the above community assessment that there was a lot of things about CompSoc that both myself and this year's committee did not know but had potential usefulness in defining our needs more specifically. I think they'd be too much depth for the brief overviews required by other categories so I'm putting at the end of this document here for anyone interested.

###1.CompSoc’s Interests

Topics and societies of extended or overlapping interests are described below:
####EUSA Societies:

 - **Engineering Innovation Society** – Started September 2016 and have no official information I could find about what exactly they actually do. Unconfirmed suggestions are that they are about ideation but how that is implemented is unclear. Potential overlapping interests with technology and hackathons but ....

 - **Edinburgh University Young Scientific Researchers Association (EUYSRA)** – Society that “is an acting catalyst for undergraduate scientific innovation and research development. EUYSRA encourages undergraduates of science related degrees to pursue and develop original and independent research, through working as members of teams consisting of people of similar academic backgrounds with the possibilities of cross departmental cooperation, thereby allowing valuable skills and appreciations for scientific research to be gained. The way this differs from a regular assigned lab to be performed for a course is that the members develop and dictate the terms of their own experiments by pursuing team generated ideas. Through the brainstorming and development of experimental ideas as members of teams (usually formed within a department), templates for small scale scientific research experiments become formed, which are then presented to the research committee who evaluate whether or not to proceed with the research having considered the cost and time to be spent on each project. If acknowledged by the research committee, a team will be allocated to one of the many laboratories available to the society. Whilst under the supervision of a lab supervisor, the teams will learn about research conduct, presentation and discussion of experimental results (which later become published on the society web page).” So theoretically CompSoc cannot therefore cannot run the same format, but otherwise are safe.

 - **Engineering Society** – Could theoretically overlap interests but only in practice run a pub crawl and Engineering Ball, and focus more on chemical and mechanical engineering than electronics or computing.

 - **MathSoc** – Many computer science students are members of both societies, although MathSoc are considerably more multidisciplinary and diverse in their membership. They have an informal social rivalry and theoretically provide competition for sponsorship from sponsors interested in supporting analytical students, but as their activities are primarily focussed on socialising, there has never been any conflict for CompSoc to run or support maths topics or events.

 - **SynBio Society** – Synthetic biology might not appear to be an area of overlapping interest for CompSoc but many SynBio members are also CompSoc as they require computer science skills and knowledge to enter a team into the annual iGEM competition and their “About” page and recruiting explicitly targets with the phrase “Computer scientist, how would you model such a system?”. Cooperative overlap though, with them offering to give interesting talks on computing in synthetic biology to recruit members.

 - **Cognitive Science Society** – Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **LangSoc** - Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **CreateSoc** – Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **Games Development Society** – Currently in rebooted form after slowly dissipating in recent years. It is being run by CompSoc members and are very interested in collaboration. I believ they did seek and receive CompSoc approval to EUSA for forming an independent society with overlap, and so CompSoc should consult them before doing things with Games Development.

 - **Design Society** – Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **Society for Quantitative Research** – Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **Entrepreneurship Society** - Exist, for topics of potential overlapping interest but have never interacted with CompSoc previously that I could discover.

 - **GameSoc** - Exist and have done a few collaborative social events in the past but sporadically as GameSoc are more socially-oriented.


####Non-EUSA Societies:

 - **Hoppers** – Women in Informatics. Career events, lab lunches, etc. An informal group.
 
 - [**Tardis**](https://wiki.tardis.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) – "The Tardis Project is a computing facility, run and maintained by students of The University of Edinburgh. It was one of the first such projects of its kind, founded in 1987 by the School of Informatics (previously Department of Computer Science) and is still held in high regard. Tardis provides services to members of the University, such as web hosting and mail access. One of the Tardis Project's main aims is to allow students at the university to be involved in running a large computing system, and learn the experience required to design, build and maintain such a system."
 
 - **Machine Learning Society** – Not officially registered with EUSA, despite an application rejected by CompSoc last year, but still holds occasional meetings and a Facebook group, consistently made of post-graduate students who felt that CompSoc was more for undergraduates, and not sufficiently specialised enough for their interests. Showed no interest in becoming a SIG.
 
 - **British Computing Society local chapter** - So we don't have a local student chapter here in Edinburgh but the BCS got in touch with CompSoc over summer to ask if we were interested in becoming one but the decision was made that it wasn't in CompSoc's interests to do so.
 
 - **After Hours Electronics Club** - School of Engineering Electrical and Electronics lecturer and legend Martin Reekie runs an out of hours 'club' in which members have access to the elctronics lab and equipment and staff supervision and support as long as you are not working on coursework. However because of logistics and insurance the club is limited to about 30 members, and so are chosen by Reekie on a case by case basis. Currently has no Informatics student members, only Engineering students, in part because it hasn't been advertised to them (although I confirmed they are welcome to join) and also because it is based at King's Buildings which Informatics students think is far away. 
 
 - **Robotics Society** – Nearly every couple of years someone attempts to make a robotics society but each time insufficient momentum and unclear goals mean it never really gets further than an initial meeting. Interestingly, these attempts are normally either made and advertised to electronics and electrical engineering students only OR informatics students only and I could find no evidence of a group in either department ever attempting communicating to another, perhaps unaware of their existence? No attempts appear to be currently active but one (engineering students) was made last academic year (2015/2016).
 
 - **Entrepreneurship Club (eClub)** – University School of Business club running regular talks on a Monday night from guest speakers ranging widely in content. Membership is free and open to anyone, taking mostly the form of a newsletter and simply attending events. Have a huge network and useful and enthusiastic staff. CompSoc may have worked with them in the past?


####CompSoc SIGs:

 - **CyberSecurity SIG** – Started this month (October 2016) for the first time after EUSA approached the committee about a request to create a new society. CompSoc rejected the society application on the premise that the organisers had never approached CompSoc to investigate the possibility of further internal support for the topic and so a SIG was created as a compromise.
 - **HackSIG** – Founded April 2016 to enable more dedicated support for hackathons. I'm the President (a role also known as HackSec)! Currently looking to run one small hackathon in January with ARM and the IET to help Informatics students build their electronics skills, and then HackTheBurgh hackathon plan in March with MLH.

 - **WebSIG** – Founded with the aim to be supporting and developing [the official CompSoc website](http://comp-soc.com/ ), working closely with Tardis who host and maintain the site. 

I have to admit, I had absolutely no idea that half of these societies existed until now, nor could I find in the short space of this week what several of them even do but will be investigating further (so watch this space for further updates). I was considering making some kind of open sourced Venn diagram or survey to make one from so that I could invite committees and/or members of all the relevant societies to fill topics or keywords for their society bubble and see where we overlap specifically?

###2. CompSoc EUSA Website Description

So this is the description that is currently up on the CompSoc section of the EUSA website. It is outdated information (it goes on to list the committee of a few year's ago) but as I was unaware of CompSoc's existence in my first year of University here, it is interesting to see how it was described then. And apart from the factually incorrect information, it is interesting to decide what should be changed about this description - who and how successfully is it communicating to potential members? This is the page everyone who wants to sign up to the club online must go to so what is it saying about us? 

Can be found [here](https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/society/compsoc/).

Welcome to CompSoc!

Whether you’re a geek, a wannabe geek, or not a geek (but for some strange reason like to hang around with them), CompSoc is for you. 
CompSoc is a student-run organization which provides avenues for inspiration, support and collaboration to students interested in computing and information technlogies. Contrary to popular belief a computing society isn't all about complaining about the latest firmware release causing more harm than not, how terrible type inferencing is, etc. (though we do this too :D), the society also focuses at computing and information techonology as a whole and its impact on society and business. So hey the main bulk of students are made up of informatics students usually, but ALL students are ENCOURAGED to join, because informatics changes the way you think :D.

If you want to get involved, check out the IRC channel, or come along to either the Wednesday social, one of the Student TechMeetups, or any of our fresher’s week events. Membership costs £4 for the year, but that includes free entry to the Student TechMeetup, subsidised trips, and lots of free pizza.

So in summary: (Look in the About page for more info on each)
1.	Meeting place for like-minded individuals with vastly different skillsets and opinions to make friends with
2.	Support for to those who want to take part in extracurricular activities. (SIGs)
3.	Workshops and Informal Lectures for first years in need of extra help especially outside normal hours provided
4.	Cascaders
5.	Student Tech Meet Up to meet up with those in industry and from our University's brilliant department to learn some cool stuff or look for career opportunities
6.	Hackathons to test your mettle against your peers for glory (people have gotten jobs from this, and some even created their own start-ups!
7.	Pub Socials and SIGs on a weekly basis
8.	Special co-op events with our friends in GameDevSoc, Hoppers, and GameSoc
9.	Other awesome events planned along the year.
10.	Another 10th reason to get your fingers stretched out counting the resons to join CompSoc

If you think you need technical/programming/informatics/blah skills to enjoy CompSoc you are wrong! we are open to anyone and everyone in the University of Edinburgh so dont be afraid to pop in and say hi!
```

###3. University of Edinburgh Statistics

Okay so we know how many members we have but how many potential members are there? To try and figure out, I found some statistics about the University of Edinburgh. Official factsheet for last year 2015/2016 [here](http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/gasp/factsheet/StudentFactsheet310716.pdf).

Then some more numbers but this time about disabilities - we've got not records about CompSoc members disabilities but I wondered if there was anyway to try and get a measure of how inclusive we are by seeing how our proportions compared to the averages for the typical profiles of CompSoc members, i.e. undergraduate Computer Science students. Found the information I got from the University Disability Services [here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/student-disability-service/about/facts-figures).

###4. LOlSoc

So LolSoc was technically a division of CompSoc in 2008 but my understanding is that CompSoc then was a purely academic organisation more of a School of Informatics student support group, and LolSoc with its interests in doing something more social created an active society that generated CompSoc now. The website describing LolSoc when it started can be found [here](https://lolsoc.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/introduction/#more-3) and is titled "informaticians are people too".

First post:
```
Computer Scientists are often generalised as having poor social lives and living in basements. LOLsoc was created to bring informaticians up to the ground floor (or down from level 5) and organise social events for the computing students at Edinburgh University.

Now beginning its second semester in existence under its new position as a division of Compsoc, LOLsoc’s beginnings were inside Teviot on a Friday afternoon on the back of a society application form. The name we came up with (after dismissing acronyms of P.E.N.I.S.) was iSoc, short for informatics. After an unidentified person gave us a tip off that the Islamic Society used this as their short name we lengthened it to InfSoc which then annoyed CompSoc. It was now that we settled on the name that Oli had come up with of “LOLsoc” with an unofficial constitution of Rick-rollin’ a lecture.

LOLsoc’s first main event was on the 28th of November last year at the Ice-skating rink in Princes Street Gardens. After a CompLog lecture many an informatician migrated to Teviot before heading out to the rink. Due to a dreaded off by 3 error when buying tickets Andrew had to sell himself to 13 year olds to get rid of excess tickets. Much skating and a seized up camera later we headed back to Teviot to warm up. The pictures from the night are here.

The last Functional Programming lecture of the semester with the legendary Phil Wadler was something to be celebrated. And in true geeky fashion LOLsoc organised a fancy dress event. As you can see, we got everything from Death-gods to jumping scouts to stormtroopers. Though the star of the show had to go to Andrew for his Lara Croft costume. (Due to certain decency laws I cannot post the winning costume here, if you really want to see it I’m sure you will find a way.)

The last event before Christmas was the Informatics Christmas Meal on the 11th of December (Party hits Revision – it’s super effective!). LOLsoc had managed to acquire level 4 of Appleton Tower for a night of Mario Kart, LAN Partying and food! (OM NOM NOM NOM). Much merriment was had and the evening was topped off by a fantastic Wadler piñata which was smashed off Stephen’s head.

Here ends the history of LOLsoc thus far. Oh, we did rickroll a lecture after all. Hell yes.
```

FAQs:

```
Q: Who are you guys?!

A: We’re Star Fox! LOLsoc, or CompSoc’s social arm, or “those guys that sit at the back of the Informatics 1 lectures and play Tetris the whole time” (we go by many names). We’re a group of first year Informatics students at the University of Edinburgh (“informatics” being a fancy name for various computer-related disciplines).

Q: What’s with the blog?

A: We were sitting around playing old Nintendo games while it snowed outside and it occurred to us that we didn’t have one. Thus, we made one.

Q: What’s going to go on it?

A: Adno. Stuff.

Q: Is this going to be one of those funny, self-referential FAQs where the questioner and answerer seem to develop distinct personalities and enter into a humourous conflict of words?

A: No.
```

So yes, it is actually funny to see the sense of humour that has been carried forward from those days (a celebration of internet memes with rickrolling a lecture then, and I Can Haz Cheezburger cat in sunglasses as club mascot now), but also the original goals of socialising being at contrast and conflict with the then official, academic CompSoc for teaching.

###5. Current CompSoc official website description

From [here](http://comp-soc.com/about) to give a current overview of CompSoc for 2016/2017.

Hello and Welcome to the Official University of Edinburgh CompSoc About Page!

We are The University of Edinburgh Computing Society and Artificial Intelligence Society, also more well known as CompSoc.

CompSoc is a student run, gigantic cooking pot of geeky people who have a healthy (yet more likely unhealthy) interest in Computing and Information technologies. This does not mean that the society is only interested in the technologies, theories and practice of Computing or how Cloud computing is just a marketing tool for a technology that’s existed a lot longer. CompSoc is also concerned with the impact of computing and information technologies to the general public as a whole.

The society encourages and provides support to those who want to collaborate with peers and staff to realise their extracurricular projects and papers. These individuals and groups become SIGs (Special Interest Group). Even inside of The University of Edinburgh’s informatics curriculum we try to provide support to students (especially those in first year) in line with their semester studies with special workshops provided by peers in CompSoc. For example: Last year we ran a midnight Haskell session from 12-4 in the morning to get ready for an exam the next morning, and attendees felt that they did much better because of it.

We also run a Student Tech Meet Up (STMU) monthly to invite industry experts, academia from the University Informatics Department, committee members, society members and many others to give talks on how/what/why they do. There’s also free pizza and fizzy drinks at these events. Always. Many topics are allowed as topics of talks and can widely differ from the norm as well. For example, we have had presentations from companies like ARM, Bloomberg, Google, Microsoft and many more. In 2016, we had ARM come to show off (then beta) mbed OS as well as two students talk about how they set up their own ticketing company at university.

It isn’t all talks, keyboards and screens however. We regularly run socials, sometimes running events with our friends in GameDevSoc, Hoppers, GameSoc and even our eternal rivals - MathSoc. Not to forget: that we have other special events lined up that one shouldn’t miss as these may form integral parts of your university memories!

So in summary:

    Meeting place for like-minded individuals with vastly different skill sets and opinions to make friends with
    Support for to those who want to take part in extracurricular activities. (SIGs)
    Workshops and Informal Lectures for first years in need of extra help especially outside normal hours provided
    Student Tech Meet Up to meet up with those in industry and from our University’s brilliant department to learn some cool stuff or look for career opportunities
    Hackathons to test your mettle against your peers for glory (people have wrangled jobs from this, and some even created their own start-ups!)
    Socials on a regular basis
    Special co-op events with our friends in Hoppers, GameSoc and Napier’s CompSoc
    Other awesome events planned along the year.

If you think you need technical/programming/informatics/blah skills to enjoy CompSoc you are wrong! We are open to anyone and everyone in the University of Edinburgh (even outwith!) so don’t be afraid to pop in and say hi!

###6. Organisation structure

How are your clubs/societies/communities structured?
- Do you have a fixed leadership team?
- How do people end up on the team? Are people elected onto that team, or is it formed of people who actively take part, etc?
- How do you manage the team?
- How do you communicate?
- How big is the team?
