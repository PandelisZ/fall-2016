## Assessing Your Community's Needs

---

### Definition

I see two communities I would like to improve here at FSU:

1. **The FSU graphics community**, which incldues a widely diverse range of majors and talent, united by their interest in graphics.
2. **The FSU tech community**, which includes all technology focused majors and student organizations.

### Size

The FSU Graphics community is small, owing to its infancy.  We have over one-hundred students on our facebook group, but we have very little engagement with most of them.  We have a more committed pool of about 30 students, though turnout faded significantly as the semester went on.

The FSU tech community has grown with hackFSU and the efforts of ACM and Technole; many other tech organizations have popped up in some colleges on campus.  However, many of the individual organizations have plateaued in size.

Ideally, the greater community would include all students interested in technology, but I don't have any good data on how many students have that interest.  My best guess is somewhere north of one-thousand-five-hundred students.

Ideally, the graphics community would have active engagement from something like 100 students, but having a consistent, core group around 30 in size is my ideal intermediate goal.

### Resources

#### Current

Upperclassmen that land interesting internships tend to bring recruiters from those companies back with them, but as soon as they graduate those connections fall apart.  This means we do have a lot of attention from companies that students typically want to work for, but this also means that these connections do not always transfer to the community.

Our school has no true space for tech on campus; we use several different spaces to host workshops and the like, but no central space for tech currently exists.

#### Ideal

I would like to see a well-funded community of tech organizations that take advantage of their differences to come up with intersting events for FSU students to take part in.

I would also love to see a vibrant community of students that take on personal projects, creative projects, or contribute to open-source projects togehter, to put into practice the things they learn from workshops, classes, or on their personal time.

With new rennovations to take place Spring 2017, our campus will finally have a central place that students can use to host workshops, seminars, and other tech-related events.  The innovation space will open Fall 2017, and I hope that means we have the opportunity to have a community with more lasting impact.

### Accessibility

FSU as an institution has a prominent culture of no from the highest levels.  Gaining access to many resources proves difficult.  The divided nature of FSU's tech community, which extends to FSU's other student organizations, means that each organization has little power to really combat issues from campus officials.

Meetings between different FSU tech organiztions tend to clash with their dates, and have very limited collaboration.  Some organizations cross promote events, but usually don't host events together.

Our campus and spaces have made some improvements for handicap accesibility, but some of the commonly used locations for events have abysmal accomodations for physically handicapped students.

#### The Ideal

FSU has made some improvements with accessibility, but with the new innovation space on our campus to start construction March 2017, we will have a dedicated home for tech on campus, with nearby parking and an extremely central, collge-neutral location on campus.  The innovation space hopes to get involvement with students from a variety of different oragnizations, and this presents a really good opportunity to mold the space to address the needs of the community.

Following the model of other spaces that exist on campus, we have begun to investigate the possiblity of establishing a student organization--some sort of tech council--that functions as an umbrella organization, primarly working to be the voice of the students in the development of the innovation space currently planned on our campus.

Our university has Student Government Offices dedicated to cultural, social, or ethnic groups on campus: the Asian American Student Union serves as the inspiration for our efforts.  They have affiliate groups (such as the Japanese Language and Culture Club, the Korean American Student Association) that host their own events, but then contribute to larger events, such as an Asian American culture festival that takes place very semester.  We hope to establish a similar organization for the Tech community at FSU, that serves a similar role, helping to coordinate large events that require the support and collaboration of _all_ the different student organizaitons.

Furthermore, we have investigated the management structure of the Student Life Cinema: a student managed, staffed, and run movie theater on FSU's campus.  The students work under faculty, and have control over the space but ultimately work closely with their faculty supervisors.  The departmental politics at FSU mean that it would be _extremely_ difficult to prevent the proposed student council from favoring one college over the others without the proper faculty advisors, who keep a larger view and focus on students and student needs over departmental politics.

### Interests

#### FSU Graphics

Graphics already includes a very wide array of interests.  Quite counter-intuitively, through graphics _is_ a specific focus, it has a wide range of application.  Right now our community focuses pretty heavily on VR, but we hope to explore and foster interests in all graphics related technologies, and find interesting intersectional applications for graphics which allow us to make connections with different communities on campus.

#### FSU Tech

Many organizations in the tech community cater to students from any major, and try to foster interest in anything related to technology or entrepreneurship, and often both.  Community members have displayed interest in a wide array of topics not directly related to computer technology, especially design.

### Goals

#### FSU Graphics

Graphics brings together a lot of unique disciplines, and thus has the unique ability to apeal to a _very_ interdisciplinary crowd.  This means, however, that members of our community have different goals.  Some students want to try cool emerging technology, some want to work on creative projects, some want to work on research, some want to take workshops and learn about graphics, and yet others want networking opportunities.

Serving these interests and helping students reach these goals requires a diverse approach, including:

- establishing a regular meetup so the community members can actually engage with each-other
- hosting workshops, especially in collaboration with other student organizations

#### FSU Tech

The greater community also has diverse interests: they want to learn things, meet recruiters from interesting tech companies, work on projects, work in startups, and have opportunities to participate in cool events like hackathons.

To serve those interests we could:

- host more niche hackathons and hack days to cater to specific interets
- bring more speakers and companies to meet the students
- find a space--online or otherwise--for students to meet with each-other, learn, and get assistance
- encourage participation in open-source projects

### Location

The FSU graphics community has no single location; since we have no direct ties to a single college, we tend to move around.

Other tech organizations have places they frequent tied to their respective colleges, or reserve spaces through the student union.

The new innovation space under construction could easily become a home for the FSU tech community.  As the plans currently stand, the space would be easily accessible, with an abundance of programmable space.

### Communication

Communication happens between several different platforms:

- an array of facebook groups
- a bunch of different slack teams
- texting & fb messgenger for individual members

Meeting the community on a platform they already use seems best, it would probably be easiest and most effective to use Facebook to establish more centralized communication, though if I had dictatorial power to force people to learn new tools I would use slack for communication & trello for task planning.

Unfortunately, we have had mixed success using Slack as a platform.  This probably stems from a lack of effort to actually teach best-practices, establish some team norms, and work with team-members on an individual level to make the platform work for **everyone**.

### Culture

Florida State University has a culture of no: students face opposition from the community to the instututional level.  The university has gatekeepers and guardians for nearly every space on campus.

Each organization has a different culture and approach.

#### Conflict Resolution

We currently have no formal system in place to handle issues in my community or in the greater community: the issues in communication I've faced often result from mis-understandings, or would find their resolution with some honest communication between the people involved.

If an impartial third-party has to step in, FSU has an ombudsman on staff we can schedule appointments with.

When I've faced these conflicts, my best course of action was to ensure that I understood the motives involved, and from there try to consider the best way forward.  When conflicts get really bad, the ombudsman would be my first choice for conflict resolution.
