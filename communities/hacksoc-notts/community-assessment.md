## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

University of Nottingham students that are interested in learning to code and are part of the hobbyist, programming and hacking society HackSoc. These are not just computer science students but students from all course disciplines, from undergrad to postgraduate. 

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?

	Approximately 220

- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?

	We would like to see the community grow each year ideally by 25% or more.

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

	Each year the society has grown, this is down to the addition of events to our calendar that have given the society more publicity and being promoted through the university events. Also the intake of new students each year brings a different group of people into our society. 

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?

	We run teaching sessions weekly on Tuesday evenings throughout both semesters, these usually cover a coding language or environment from the very beginning. 
	We have a hardware lab which loans technology out to our members over the course of the year for people to access hardware. 
	We also organise an annual hackathon where students can meet companies from the tech industry who sponsor this and take part in tech challenges to win prizes. 
	I am the lead organiser of the Women in Technology conference day which HackSoc and the University host, which provides access to students and the wider community to learn about technology roles and tries to break down some of the barriers for gender equality in STEM careers. Additionally we have high engagement with the TechNottingham monthly meet up and invite guest speakers from the wider tech community in every fortnight to talk about how they use technology and deliver workshops. 

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

	Yes - weekly, fortnightly and monthly meet ups
	Yes - weekly seminars
	Yes - Open source resources for all of our teaching
	No - our office hours are flexible as we are all full time students so we use Slack as a communication tool and emails to reach out to our soc members
	Yes - HackNotts every November

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?

	We try to keep everything open source in terms of materials, we also allow contributions to our web pages. Hardware is booked through email and the community messages managed through social media and slack.

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?

	Yes - we offer votes to our members when scheduling any new activities to ensure we are setting the best time for the majority.

- Is there childcare available?

	No

- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?

	Yes - the University buildings where we host events provide full disabled access.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

	Our community is made up of a range of students, we are very happy that this is the case. Though it can sometimes mean events are interesting to all members. We do try and vary the topics of seminars and workshops as well as gauge our members interests when organising these.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?

	Because they want to learn to program, engage with the hackathon community, learn new skills and meet people with the same interests.

- Are they students hoping to get a degree?

	Yes

- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?

	Potentially some of our members will be using our lessons to add skills to their CV. 

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?

	Yes, the majority of our members are interested in learning, building and creating - regardless of their subject of study. 

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

	The goals I would set to my community would be: 
		1. Help every member to learn 1 skill and get them to confirm this. 
		2. Branch out our discussions and sessions to ensure we are giving people the right information for their level.
		3. Increase publicity of the society, especially onto our other campus, to non science degrees and within the local community. 
		4. Continue to grow the society membership numbers and attendance to our annual events. 
		5. Gain gold status with the Student's Union. 

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?

	The School of Computer Science.

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?

	The community largely interacts online outside of our events, we do not have a dedicated drop in space. 

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?

	Parking is available, it is free after 16:30 on weekdays and at weekends.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?

	Yes and if we are venturing off campus we organise a group meet up at a location in order to travel together. 

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?

	Yes.

- How much does it cost to use the space?

	It is free. We sometimes have to pay domestic cleaning costs to the university for our events, but the building hire is free. 

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?

	We use the Hub in Computer Science and this is quite flexible for our needs.

- How many people can it fit?

	The room can fit approximately 100 people. 

- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?

	Yes there is a range of seating in this room.

- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

	There is a water cooler nearby and vending machine, however during events that aren't teaching we provide refreshments. 

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?

	Slack, Facebook, Twitter, Email.

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?

	Yes there is a weekly email to our members, we have a GitHub Organization @HackSocNotts , a Facebook group, Twitter and a slack channel. 

- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

	Our community currently uses all the suggested communication methods, but it would be interesting to understand which gets the most engagement from our members. 

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?

	The community spirit is all about learning something new, we try to introduce new members throughout the year and don't just invite people to join at the beginning of semesters. We try very hard to support new ideas. 

- What happens if there is a disagreement?

	The President of the society usually will become involved if there is a disagreement, whereby we will try to mediate any issues between the parties involved.

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?

	We have guidelines for this from the Student's Union and generally ask our members to adhere to a Code of Conduct similar to that of hackathon events. 

- How will you personally handle it?

	Personally, I am not great at confrontational matters that include myself, with others however I can be a good listener and mediator. I would ensure both parties felt supported by the society and try to get them to discuss the problems with understanding of the other's viewpoint.
