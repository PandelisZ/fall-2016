## Summary of the Community's Needs

The HackSoc Community is a student community from a range of disciplines, it is on the larger size in terms of how many members it has (200+) but the number of these that engage in the community is considerably less, below 50. 

Currently HackSoc have access to rooms that can be used for events and plenty of resources to run teaching sessions. There are good links with sponsors who continue to support the society and the society has a slack channel that is used for communications. 

Communications are something that are lacking, there is a weekly email but this can be sporadic in its sending and compiling, the members that run the society have some difficulty coming together in one place and of late there hasn't been good communication to members for HackSoc events, there is no strategy it is as and when people are available which can seem inconsistent. This could also make the society team seem inaccessible to members as they often seem too busy too be accessible. 

The preferred method of communication is slack - there is a Facebook group and Twitter but the majority of communications are done through email and discussion in slack. 

The culture within HackSoc is about making and doing. It promotes learning coding skills and those that engage are people who are enthusiastic about learning something new and making a thing, they are often beginners and a mix of new CS students and students from other disciplines. 

## Your Proposal

In this section, articulate the project you want to accomplish during the Campus Experts program; provide a brief summary of what you are planning to accomplish with your project.

The HackSoc community needs to evaluate the communication with it's members now that the society has continued to grow, preferred methods may not be the most suitable or effective for the current audience so it would be good to evaluate engagement using social media analysis tools. 

This would require gathering this data and presenting it to the HackSoc executive committee, which would fall within my role on the committee of Outreach and Inclusivity Secretary. 

It would be appropriate to hold this meeting at the end of the Autumn semester to evaluate the messaging in this period and learn from what did and didn't work, in order to apply this to a strategy for after the holiday period. 

The plan's aim should not be to increase the community (i.e. promote what we do to those who aren't members) but to increase the engagement within the society. There would be a goal to ensure our members see value in being part of the society and feel valued by the community. 

Addressing our overall messaging would address the following goals: 

- Ensure HackSoc are using the most effective way of contact our members
- Provide HackSoc members with knowledge of how best to contact or contribute to the community
- Increase engagement by reaching people through their most used method
- Increase communications & awareness of HackSoc 
- Identify the best methods to keep in contact with the members of the community

The communication of this plan will begin with in-person meetings amongst the committee and communications to our members via social media for their input into our future communications. 

The community will continue to communicate through the existing methods (Slack, Facebook, Twitter & Email) which will be assessed when this proposal is implemented. 


## Your Proposal's Impact

The target audience for this proposal is all HackSoc members, with a focus on the less active members of the society. 

It aims to address and understand the needs of newer members who may not be aware of how HackSoc operate or aren't sure how to engage with the community. 

Resources required to enact this proposal will be open source analytic software (often provided by social media tools and platforms). 

The proposal will be delivered in a presentation to the committee and a recorded round table discussion about how the society will address this in the next semester. 

Following this a set of guidelines for the engagement and messaging could be created within the HackSoc Organisation on GitHub and on any society shared drives for future committee members to be aware of and evaluate. 

As an individual I have previously working in music promotions and communications for events, I have good knowledge of social media platforms and tools, along with history in growing social media accounts (inspire WIT Twitter account - from 79 followers to 1000+). I am aware of good practices in messaging and feel that I would be able to effectively impact this proposal. 

To grow this knowledge I could access community blogs, discuss with other campus experts and test a variety of social media delivery tools available online. I could also take free online courses on communications and encourage my peers on the committee to do the same. 


Timeline: 

Nov-Dec (approx. 2 weeks) = Analyse current social media communications 
Dec (before 16th December) = Present findings to committee and hold round table discussion
Dec-Jan (approx. 4 weeks) = Develop strategy & documents to support this, with community input
Jan = hold meeting with committee to confirm strategy & put into place

## Planning for the Future

The impact of this proposal could be evaluated throughout and at the end of the spring semester, through social media analysis and levels of engagement in future HackSoc activities from the society members. 

Success would be quantified by number of members engaging in activities, however there could also be qualitative data in terms of asking the community for feedback once the strategy is in place. 

This is a plan that could be iterated each semester, as this would give time enough to evaluate if the preferred methods of communication have changed (they may fluctuate month to month so a longer period would give more realistic engagement data)

It could be written into the role of both Inclusivity and Outreach, as well as General Secretaries to consider this at the end of each semester.
