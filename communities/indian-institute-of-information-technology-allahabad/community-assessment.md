# Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad

### Definition
Students at [Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad](http://iiita.ac.in/)

### Size

There are ~1000 undergrads and ~500 postgraduates pursuing Information Technology (~70%) and related streams (~30% - Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bio-Medical and Stem Cell Engineering) in the university. We plan to target the students who are attending the first and second year.

### Resources

Students occasionally conducts workshops on Web development, Competitive Programming, Open Source, App development etc. We host two hackathons every year at the university. IIIT-A hacks which is the inter university hackathon and [Hack In The North](http://www.hackinthenorth.com/) which is an inter University hackathon. 

### Accessibility
The workshops are accessible to everyone. We try to conduct workshops when there are no classes in the University. 
The classes are held in University classrooms. The workshops are beginner friendly and cover the concepts from beginning. Most of the workshops are taken by the members of the technical society of the college. 

### Interests
The community is made up of mostly students pursuing Information Technology. Other than competitive programming most of the students would be interested in web development, open source contributions and app development.

### Goals
Very few students are interested in development at the University. Majority of the students spend their time doing competitive programming(hackerrank, spoj, codeforces etc). The main goal is to change this culture and encourage students to get involved in Open Source and Development. Most of the first year students attend the workshops. The participation from second and third years are very small. Even though there is a significant number of students participating in workshops very few stick with development after the first year. Most of them move to competitive programming and leave development and open source completely. The goal is to increase the number of students who continue with open source and development after the first year.

### Location
The community gather in university classrooms and labs for attending workshops and hackathons. They are free to use but require permission from faculty incharge. All most all the students stay in campus hostels. Water is available 24x7. Snacks are available from the nearby cafeteria.
	
### Communication
We use university mailing groups and facebook groups for communication. It would be good to have a chat room and a Github organization. We can possibly setup a Zulip instance or use a slack group for communication.

### Culture
 The community is welcoming to new students and ideas. Most of the workshops are focused on first years which we assume have zero knowledge on development. We try to teach everything from scratch. Disagreements are usually handled using polls. It would good to have well documented policies.
