## Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Definition

- ISI Web Devs

Information Systems Engineers students interested on going beyond what is taught on the classrooms and learn web development related technologies.

### Size

< TODO: figure out how many CS students are there >

They goal is to have a medium size group between 50 & 100 students interested in helping each not only become great Information Systems Engineers but to also go beyond want is taught in the classrooms.

### Resources

There are some talks given by the students and people from local companies. But they are not frequent and the group that attends is small.

### Accessibility

Through the **Students Group** when can make the arrangements to get resources from the University. This is a bureaucratic process though.

Meetings should be arranged during hours that are accessible for the majority of the students.

* _The Students Group or Students Center is a group of students that represent the interests of all the students community. Kind of like a Students Party_.

### Interests

They idea would be to target students that are already in the CS field.

### Goals

They goal of the community is to grow as a whole and to be able cover the topics and areas that the current CS degree can not cover, specifically the areas related to web development.

The goal would be to target students that are eager to learn not only what they can learn on the classrooms but go beyond that.

Meetups, talks and workshops held monthly. Also build an online community focused on sharing and helping each others to grow as web developers.

### Location

The best location for the meetings would be on campus since students go there daily.

There is public transportation and free parking.

It is possible to get free access to classrooms that can accommodate the participants well enough. These classrooms have projectors and desks so either workshops, meetups and talks can be held.

### Communication

Students communicate mostly through social networks and messaging systems.

Creating a Github organization, a Trello board and an Slack team would help cover communication.

  - **Github organization**: sharing resources, slides, workshops code, etc.
  - **Trello board**: voting workshops/talks topics, speakers, etc.
  - **Slack team**: have a space were students can share resources and help each others. Having a more open way to communicate between community members.

### Culture

Students like new ideas, but they tend to be rude when they communicate online. A strong **Code of Conduct** is important to improve in this aspect. Disagreements should be handled politely and look for a solution that takes into account everybody's interests. Some kind of penalty should be included in the Code of Conduct.
