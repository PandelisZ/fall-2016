Now that you've [thought about your community's needs](community-assessment.md), it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a :sparkles: impact on your community.

## Summary of the Community's Needs

Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: 30 core members, 100 members that come and go; The majority (>90%) are studying a CS degree, the rest are studying some other STEM degree (Maths, Neuroscience, Physics). The core team provides computer science workshops(Android/iOS, Web, C++, algorithms), hackathons (HackKing's, HackLondon, First Year Hack, Local Day Hack), surgery-style sessions (SOS Java). These are open to everyone and are beginner friendly and the materials are provided on the Tech Societies' Github page or specific facebook pages.
- **Communication**: There are two slack channels (one aimed at organising the events/workshops/hackathons, one public), facebook pages for each event/workshop/hackathon, twitter, snapchat, newsletter, dedicated website. Facebook pages are the most used, followed by slack and twitter. Core members sent newsletter weekly.
- **Culture**: Everyone is welcomed, regardless of their belief, ethnicity and background. We don't really have disagreements, but when they do happen, we try to act in a peaceful and constructive way and we also try to avoid toxic people. In terms of the core team, we want everyone to be involved in something (event/workshop etc). Those who do not prove their interest in the society and are not proactive are asked to leave.


## Your Proposal

In this section, articulate the project you want to accomplish during the Campus Experts program; provide a brief summary of what you are planning to accomplish with your project.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Timing**: The changes I am thinking of will applied during next academic year after being debated with the rest of the committee.
- **Community demographics**:The majority of the community studies computer science. We need more people from other STEM subject getting involved,as technology is present in all these fields in one way or another. I would like the proportion of CS/Non-CS students to be fairly equal. I would like to approach the Non-CS students with some workshops/events aimed at technology used in their specific areas. 
- **Goals**: Balance the CS/Non-CS students involved with the community to a ratio of 70-30(from 90-10). 
- **Communication**: Organisation wise, slack and google drive to store important documents. Communication between the core team and the rest of the community is best deliver through facebook groups and newsletter.


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Non-CS STEM students withing King's College London
- Community needs
  - Introducing the target audience to technology events and involving them into events/workshops about their specific area of interest (ie Physics)
- Resources
  - Workshops content on different areas, connection with people working with technology from the specific areas, identifying interesting events. 
  - Lots of researching, asking people already involved in the community for guidance.
- Media
  - Interactive workshops(ie live coding), presentations, guiding people to attend events of interest.
  - Researching, inviting people of interest to do sessions with the students.
- Content knowledge
  - Not very knowledgeable, but I am prepare to learn from others in order to achieve the goals described above.
  - Connection to other societies in the university, professors and people in the community with more knowledge than me. 
- Timeline
  - Research about technology in other STEM areas -> identify people that could help me achieve this -> plan a useful workshop/event with a person of interest 
  - Advertise interesting events on our page
  - Collaborate with other sociaties

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- I will review the impact proposal once I have more knowledge of what can be done
- My efforts will be successful when I see more Non-CS students getting involved with our community
- I will iterate after every attempted event and see how I can improve the next one
