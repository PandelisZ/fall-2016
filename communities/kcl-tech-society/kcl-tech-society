## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community: 
  - Students of King's College London part of the tech society/community


### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  - 30 core, about 100 that come and go.

- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - Giving the fact that there are around 2500 students in STEM degrees(UG+PGT), only 5% are members of the society. I would like to improve our numbers to around 300 members(12%),
  and balancing the CS/Non-CS student ratio to 70-30.

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - Yes, by introducing and supporting underepresented people to study tech. 

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - Online materials, hackahtons, workshops, sharing information. Unfortunately I do not have any statistics I can share about the numbers of attendees or recurring people.

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  - Yes.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  - Pretty accessible.

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - No, the few that exist are outside office hours.

- Is there childcare available?
  - Most likely the university provides this.
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
  - Yes.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  - The majority are from computer science degree, few from other STEM degrees, but would be amazing if other people from different areas would join us.

- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - The main interest is tech, but the topics are as many as are the persons in the community.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  - Some get involved because of the way the community supports it's memebers, other out of curiosity or love for the topic.

- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  - Yes.

- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
  - I don't believe so.

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  - Yes.

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  - Organising/attending hackathons, being known as tech people, developing usable products.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
  - There is never a time when all memebers are present, but the majority gather at HackKings.

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
  - Yes, diverse slack channels, facebook groups.

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
  - There is, but it's usually busy. Although I do not think people need it.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
  - Yes.

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
  - Yes.

- How much does it cost to use the space?
  - It doesn't, but the space needs to be booked in advance, otherwise there might be possible not to get one.

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
  - Flexible.

- How many people can it fit?
  - Maximum is around 200 in one room, but there can be multiple rooms available.

- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
  - Yes.

- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
  - Yes.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
  - Usually in slack( mostly core members and some dedicated members), facebook group, website of Tech Society, email etc.

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
  - Yes, all of them.

- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
  - The tech society provides all of them, but the one who cost need to be provided by our own money.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
  - Very, we are open to anyone.

- What happens if there is a disagreement?
  - We try to resolve it peacefully and we try to avoid negative or toxic people.

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - There are some in regards to room bookings, membership and the likes.

- How will you personally handle it?
  -One thing I would do is have surgery hours with more experienced developers to help people start out/ improve in a speicifc area and have meetings/workshops on non-mainstream technologies.
