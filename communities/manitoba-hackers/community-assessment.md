##Manitoba Hackers

##Definition
* University students interested in tech and coding at the University of Manitoba (population: 28 000 students) . It is our hope that the community grows beyond just the University of Manitoba, as there are neighbouring universities at University of Winnipeg (population: 10 000 ) and Brandon University (population: 3000) and several high schools in Winnipeg that teach programming.

##Size
* Currently there is a Developers club at the University of Manitoba with a Facebook membership of about 80 members. However, there are only about 25-30 members who actively attend meetings.
* The potential for growth is very high since there are **>700 computer science** students enrolled in the department of Computer Science. This does not include students who are in Computer Engineering and other engineering disciplines. Ideally, we would like to have at least a quarter of the students enrolled in computer science to be involved with Manitoba Hackers, i.e. ~180.

* The limitation for growth depends on the number of interesting workshops/events that can be created. It also depends on how many students would like to spread awareness about the group.

##Resources
* There is currently a developers club that meets on a weekly basis to allow members to learn about technology and have monthly hack nights
* Since Winnipeg is a fairly isolated city, there are few hackathons that are within a driving distance. The closest hackathon to Winnipeg is MinneHacks, which is a 7.5 hour drive. Even further is HackISU (9 hour drive) and Hack K-State (12 hour drive). However, the start-up tech community is quickly growing in an area known as the Exchange District, a small hub for new tech start-ups to set up their operations. It is here where many computer science students find internship positions.
* SkullSpace is a hackerspace located 30 minutes from the university that provides 24 hour access to resources such as a hardware lab, 3-D printer and space for soldering. Weekly meetings attract developers from the surrounding community and provide occasional workshops as well.


##Accessibility
* The Developers Club meetings are held in the Engineering building classrooms, but do not currently have a set structure and attrition is very high amongst the membership. There lacks a consistent meeting location and room locations frequently change at the last minute. This makes it difficult at times for members to find meetings.
* Meetings are held once a week on Thursdays with attendance about 20-30 people.
* The school classrooms are quite accessible for those with disabilities.



##Interests
* The community is made up of only computer science students, but it is our hope that students from outside the department come to learn more about coding. The engineering department remains a large population that have yet to integrate into the community.
* There lacks structure in the current group, a re-evaulation will be conducted and a new community may be required to be created to change the current structure of meetings.

## Goals
* Students have expressed their concern that there are few opportunities for them to engage in the developer community outside of class.
* Many students want to join a group to build side projects and improve their coding skills outside of class. The material taught in class rarely reflects what current employers desire. It is our hope that Manitoba Hackers can provide students with an ability to bridge that gap in knowledge.

* Outide of actually building projects, Manitoba Hackers can also be a place where students can find resources to find and prepare for tech jobs. Certain meetings can be dedicated to technical interview prep and introduce online resources such as LeetCode and Interview Cake.
* The passion for developing remains low and we are hoping to get students to participate in more activities outside of class such as hackathons. We will be hosting our first ever hackathon called HackCentral between February 17th-19th, 2017 and hope to attract 450 students (college and high school) from across the province.
* We will also be inviting members of SkullSpace to provide workshops such as Intro to Git, or Intro to Arduino programming.

##Location
* The community gathers in school classrooms once a weekly
* Parking is free after school hours and there is a free bus pass for all students.
* It is difficult for certain students to remain on campus after class as most students live off-campus and most live with their families.
* The cost to book rooms at the university is free of charge and there are large projectors in most rooms.
* Each room fits about 50 people maximum
* Water is close by, but the lack of funding makes providing snacks quite challenging.

##Communitcation
* Online informal chats for the community happen at the DevClub slack channel as well as the Manitoba Hackers facebook group. 83 members are in the DevClub slack and 49 members are in the facebook group.
* Having a github could also make storing projects a lot easier and for others to collaborate.

## Culture
* There isn't a strong leadership team right now in the community and it is a challenge to find other individuals who will dedicate their time to grow the community. Building a strong team is the next step we plan to take in building the community.
* Disagreements would be mediated by at least 2 people who are impartial to the situation.
* A Code of Conduct will be drafted for the Manitoba Hackers to ensure that all members can participate free of harrassment. 
* To handle disagreements, I hope to have private conversations with all parties involved before making any judgements on taking any necessary action.
