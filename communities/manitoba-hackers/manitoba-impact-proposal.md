
## Summary of the Community's Needs

**Community demographics**: 

* The Manitoba Hacker community is relatively small with approximately 25-30 members who attend our local student hacker club called .devClub. It is a community centered around weekly meetings and occasional hack days where students can meet to create a project of their choosing. Most students who choose to join the community are in their upper years as very few first years are aware of the club’s existence. The potential to increase the community’s size is massive as there has been an influx of new students into both the departments of Computer Science (>700 students) and Computer Engineering.

* The community also is able to obtain room bookings from the university free of charge as well as event funding from the Science Student Association and UMSU (University of Manitoba Student Union). Furthermore, the Computer Science Students Association also help host events for students during the school year. The club lacks hardware tools, but have a maker space called SkullSpace that is approximately 40 minutes away by bus. 


 **Communication**: 
 * Our community tends to communicate predominantly through slack and through facebook. There is a dedicated Facebook group called “Manitoba Hackers” that posts regularly about hacker-related events. In the future, our hope is to utilize email as an option as well. 

 **Culture**
* The culture within the hacker community has yet to be defined as students are quite dispersed throughout the department. There is not much of a unified community at school since the students who attend the U of M mainly live with their parents and commute from their homes. Many students choose to leave shortly after classes are over. That said, a small group of dedicated students do meet on a weekly basis, but there is almost an underground culture to the club. Communication about the club is kept to word-of-mouth and may exclude new students who want to join. 


## Proposal

* Over the next few months, I hope to set up a dedicated website and blog for the student hacker community as I will be away from campus. I want to grow the online community around the school and help to work with my friends to build the hacker community. Posts will be about hacker events around the city and also helping students organize their local hacker events. At the same time, I will work closely with the local developers club to organize a weekly speaker series and to invite speakers from around Winnipeg to talk and educate students about new technologies. We will also try working with MLH and setting up local host events to complement our own planned events. 


* For those who can’t physically make it to meetings, a webinar will also be under consideration for student hackers to meet online and to bring in guest speakers as well.  

* There will also be a focus on getting students to try attending hackathons that are in the surround area such as MinneHacks in Minneapolis and Calhacks. 
The goals of the community assessment is to get more people hacking and to build new side projects. Students also want to build industry skills to complement their classroom education. With the webinar, online blog and the hacker nights at school, students will be able to accomplish all of these goals.



## Impact
- Target audience:
  - The target audience are the university students in Manitoba who are interested in technology and building projects. 
- Community needs
  - We are specifically trying to increase the hacker community and encourage students to meet others and build upon their ideas using technology. 
- Resources
  - The primary need of the community is to obtain funding to support students who come to events such as purchasing new hardware such as arduinos, raspberry pi’s and paying for food at hacker nights. 
  - We will be applying for funding with the university’s student union as well as getting funding with the science student association and the department of Computer Science. 
- Media
  - It is my goal to identify other student leaders in the community to help with running the developer club on campus. Since the plan is quite ambitious, there will be a need to fund a group of dedicated students who can take time off school to help support the group. 
- Content knowledge
  - I have had experience meeting other hackers at other hackathons and learned mostly through discussion on what helps hacker growth. At the same time, I hope to reach out to others at the MLH organizer slack as well as emailing the Florida Hackers for ideas. 
  

## Planning for the Future
- I will review the proposal in mid February to see if the plans are still feasible and speak with other GitHub experts on their opinions on whether our plans can be improved. 
- The main measure of success will be done through surveys sent out to the community and asking for feedback from participants on their satisfaction. If most students rate their satisfaction as either average or above average, then the community would be considered a success. Other metrics could be counting the number of people attending webinars and meetings. If there are >30 people attending consistently, then that would also be considered a success. 
- Community plans will be iterated every 4 months and meetings will be set up with other student leaders to figure out the proper course of action.
