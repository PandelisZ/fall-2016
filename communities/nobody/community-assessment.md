# nobody

## Definition
 * A open source contributing group currently consists of students.
 * We contribute to the open source projects, and train more studetns to get involved.

## Size
 * Currently
   * We have about 13 students and 5 mentors here, and had about 4 or 5 students per generation before.
 * Ideally
   * It'll be good to have about 20~30 students each round!

## Resources
 * We teach and learn about git, GitHub flow, nodejs, shellscript and Linux related knowledges.
 * We have course every week, and also have non-periodical hackathons.

## Accessibility
 * The courses are after class.
 * Since we are all young students without child, so there is no childcare yet.
 * We don't have disabled member yet, and will be happy to make sure the accessibility for them once we are going to have!

## Interests
 * Our community consists of computer science students, but are not limited to that, hope to have some students from other majors in future.
 * All the free and open source related topics could be welcome here.

## Goals
 * People get involved in our community would
   1. Like to learn about how to involve in open source project contribution, and learn some development tools/skills/experience.
   2. Like to share about how to involve in open source project contribution, and teach some development tools/skills/experience.
 * We don't have any "degree" and I think nobody would come here for a degree.
 * We hope the students been trained will have the ability the contribute to many of the interesting projects by the correct work flow and methods.

## Location
 * Taiwan

## Communication
 * We use Telegram, Facebook and Slack to communicate with each others.

## Culture
 * Don't say we have nobody to do something or nobody can do something, we are the "nobody".
 * Instead of just complaining about the wrong things, we go and hack it, improve it.
 * Learn from the whole world, even from a passers-by, and spread what the good things you learned.
 * Contributing to the community as well as learning the skills at the same time, most of the practices will become real contributions in the world.
