Now that you've [thought about your community's needs](community-assessment.md), it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a :sparkles: impact on your community.

## Summary of the Community's Needs

Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: 5 core members, 15 normal members, 100% consists of CS student, we core members are now trying to train the 15 new comes about git, GitHub flow, markdown and other essentials about contributing to the FOSS projects.
- **Communication**: Slack, Facebook group and messenger, face to fact communication.
- **Culture**: Start to learn, don't be afraid of the past experience, contribute back to the community!


## Your Proposal

We now have 2 hours course every week, and will have a workshop in December, maybe a hackathon in January, I'm not going to make the increasing the community size a main goal, as most of the students super interested in contributing free and open source projects already started their way to do it, our target are those students are just interested, but didn't find their way to start yet, the students want to be trained.

Our gaol is to make the students originally didn't know about git, GitHub, open source culture can be able to pick the projects they are using and then contribute to the project they picked. We start from collecting the super easy to solve [issues](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/9248) for the students, those issues are libraries on CDNJS lack of license info, the listed libraries in the issue are picked by confirmation of the clear license info, and send pull request from using GitHub web UI to add the missing license, students will learn the concept of git and GitHub, web library, how to fork repository, create git branch, write commit message, mention related issue on GitHub, and then send the pull request on GitHub. After that, there are courses about git command line, GitHub workflow, git branching, ... kinds of related skills and knowledge to make them get the essential skill to contribute.

We now use Facebook group, Facebook messenger, Slack, and GitHub (issue/PR comment) to communicate with each other.

## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Students being interested in free and open source projects but don't have enough domain knowledge and skills.
- Community needs
  - Introducing about free and open source projects, how they impact our life and the world, why should we learn and what will we get from it.
- Resources
  - Classroom or meeting room, we could bower from school.
  - Some helpful swags(not sure if I should call it swag), like GitHub Git cheat sheet poster and stickers, I already received some from GitHub Education.
  - Teachers and TAs, we already have 5 active people as core members and few more not very active but can also help and join.
  - Foods and drinks for workshop and hackathon, I could buy some.
- Media
  - We'll have slides for it
- Content knowledge
  - I think I'm fine with the topics as that are the things I'm doing everyday :)
- Timeline
  - We now have a two hours course (almost) every and about an one hour TA hour, will keep it to the end of this semester and decide if we'll still have it in the winter vacation.
  - We are going to held a workshop in one of the December weekends

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
  - Once the courses finished
- How will you measure success?
  - See if we'll get new students to join core members
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
  - Every two weeks or one month
