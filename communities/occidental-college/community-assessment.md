# Occidental College

### Definition
- Students interested in tech at Oxy
- Open to anyone, heavily focusing on POCs and WOCs

### Size
- There is roughly ~2000 students at Occidental. Oxy only has a computer science minor,  with roughly ~120 students enrolled in a class every semester. However, roughly 20% of students are STEM majors.
- I'd like to help grow the CS curriculum/minor, ideally to the same amount of Oxy STEM majors (~400) in the next couple years. 

### Resources
- Aside from the minor, there aren't many ways to learn about tech at Oxy. There are STEM-related clubs (POC in STEM, WiSTEM, and Oxy Open Source) that aren't actively hosting tech related meetings.
- There is a CS opportuntity mailing list, filtered by the CS department chair.
- Occidental has a Critical Maker Studio, where they offer beginner-level techy workshops and tinkering kits (Arduinos, Raspberry Pis). However they often do not get high numbers in attendance because lack of advertising.

### Accessibility
- Current resources seem to only target those who are already tech savvy, restricting involvement from those with interest but limited tech skills.

### Interests
- I am interested in opening up the community to all backgrounds, as long as one has an interest, they have a community!
- That being said, the community will not only talk about tech, but the environment of tech and the gender/ethic/socio-economic gap. Topics will include imposter syndrome and how to combat these stereotypes.
- Also interested in various interdisciplinary topics with CS, not limited to STEM topics.
- 

### Goals
- At Occidental, most active clubs on campus advocate for some social good. I plan that this community will advocate for diversity in CS and STEM.
- Though Oxy only has a minor, the department is expanding and hoping to have a major in the nearby future. With this community on campus, it will bring awareness needed to kickstart the major creation process.
- Everyone in the club should have an interest in tech.
- I hope to plan group projects and workshops for all levels.

### Location
- Meeting rooms and classrooms can be rented out for a certain time everyday.
- Community will meet online and in person

### Communication
- Ideal ways for communication between the community would be: email, Facebook page/group, and a personal website.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

### Culture
- This community will be welcoming to all types of ideas. All new ideas will be communicated respectfully, regardless on what medium it is passed on. New members are a plus - always welcome!
- The community will heavily be focused on inclusion in CS; any kind of harassment will not be tolerated. Harassment == removal from the community.
