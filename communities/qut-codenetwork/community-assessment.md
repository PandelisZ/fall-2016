## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  - Generally speaking; students, staff and alumni of Queensland University of Technology and industry professionals in Brisbane, Australia.
  - CodeNetwork was founded from QUT and now has a national, and somewhat international, presence.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  - Currently we have 2,225 members.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - What's the population of the MultiVerse?
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - We have grown from 6 founding members in almost two years.
  - Events such as hackathons and more specifiably the media attention they bring have catapulted membership numbers.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - We hold a weekly meetups that are open to anyone.
  These are generally focused on bringing developers from industry in to speak, demo,
  and otherwise just interact with students. Strictly developers, no HR.
  - Hackathons are held twice a year, running over a weekend.
  We have had huge success running these and have found them to be extremely beneficial to the community.
  Most recently one team made the Australian Census Great Again, handling 4x the load with a $1000 budget
  which they spent only $30 of.
  - We use the [CodeNetwork](facebook.com/groups/WeCodeAlot/) Facebook Page for general communication and community interaction. 

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  - There is no restriction on attending out events or joining the FaceBook page. Except for Recruiters to an extent.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - Typically we try to hold all events outside of regular business hours.
- Is there childcare available?
  - No.
- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
  - Yes.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  - Primarily yes. There are quite a few electrical and mechanics engineers scattered around too.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - I'd say the primary intrest of our community of web application development
  but everyone is very open to pretty much anything.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  - To learn and share common interests.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  - The majority of our community are students.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
  - Some are, some aren't.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  - All active members are.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  - Run more workshops based on community requested content.
  - Develop a more interactive online presence to facilitate projects, job listings etc.
  - World domination.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
  - Generally at the QUT campus. Occasionally events are held off campus.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
  - Both. Weekly meetups occur.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
  - Yes, no.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
  - Yes
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
  - Yes. Even on campus events are open to non-students.
- How much does it cost to use the space?
  - We have only used event spaces that were free thus far.
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
  - On campus can be difficult for more complex events.
  In that event we generally look towards local co-working spaces for event space.
- How many people can it fit?
  - Typical weekly meetup space can accommodate ~100.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
  - Yes.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
  - Yes.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
  - [CodeNetwork](facebook.com/groups/WeCodeAlot/) Facebook Page.
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
  - All of the above. Slack is relatively inactive though. Facebook page is very active.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
  - I think it could benefit from a more active Slack. We have tried to drive interest in this with little success.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
  - Very. Culture is very important to us.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
  - Thus far we have had very few conflicts within the community and these have been dealt with very quickly.
  We have banned members from Facebook and asked a few not to addend events due to this.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - We enforce a single rule; don't be a dick.
- How will you personally handle it?
  - Timeout in the corner for all those involved.
