### Week 1

About my community:

##### Definition
Durham's technical community is very much focused on theoretical Computer Science, so the idea of a hackathon is completely foreign to most students here. If I were to summarize my community in one line, it would be:
~ "University students who are just discovering the hacker culture"

It would be wonderful to see our computer scientists more involved in extra-curricular activities, which would also give them the opportunity to bond with others over a love for technology, regardless of their academic backgrounds. Perhaps by bringing the hacker culture to them, and exposing them to the benefits of getting involved, they would be more inclined to participate. Raising awareness, and giving them the opportunity to experience it for themselves, is definitely the way forward.

##### Size
The community still remains rather small, with roughly 20 staying committed to the Computing Society. Fewer than 10 people, amongst the hundreds of us, regularly attend hackathons. It would truly be ideal if at least a quarter of all our computer science students were involved in hackathons. The group was much smaller before, with CompSoc having only 5 members, but we have been able to entice people to commit to the society by running workshops, and giving out free pizza with the money that we get from sponsors.

##### Resources
Lectures, and lectures alone. The students are not driven to learn things outside of the course because they don't realize just how much they are capable of building. Meetups happen every week with CompSoc, where we occasionally hold workshops and teaching sessions, but the responsibility of organizing it falls in the hands of very few people, making it difficult to hold such events too often (with the exception of the meetups). We would definitely appreciate support from our department to run events. Hopefully, by sparking enthusiasm, more would be encouraged to take part, allowing work to be delegated and more events to take place.

##### Accessibility
Meetings are held after lectures on Monday, so it has not been possible to get access to any form of professional help, such as from lecturers, demonstrators, etc. The venue where the meetups are held is also quite a distance away from the University's main site, which may deter some from attending the meetup.

##### Interests
My community is mostly made up of computer science students, but hopefully that will change. I would like to get as many people involved in technology as possible, so that they can cultivate a passion for it; and it's a real plus that a diverse skillset tends to churn out the best ideas, too.

##### Goals
They usually get involved to learn how to code (and to enjoy the free pizza, for sure). The business students tend to get involved to learn more about the different ways that they can leverage tech for their startup ideas. It would likely encourage a lot more people to join if we could run regular workshops for our students.

##### Location
The community usually gathers in the Students' Union building, which is conveniently located close to town. However, the infrastructure in the building is really lacking; we do not even have enough power sockets to supply our members power with. Having no A/V equipment in the building makes running workshops difficult, too; but, more importantly, without any rooms suitable for large numbers of people, it has truly been a challenge to try to keep students committed, especially when they are forced to squeeze uncomfortably into a room. At most, the room could hold 40 people, and there are vending machines nearby.

##### Communication
There is a Slack channel, which is currently still undersubscribed, so our primary communication channel is through internal mailing lists, as well as a Facebook page. Having more communication channels might not be beneficial, but we should instead focus on improving the students' response to these channels.

##### Culture
We encourage anyone to come for the events, regardless of their skills. Since we would like more people to get involved, we definitely value their input as much as we value ours. We run on a casual basis, so no documentation is involved, although we do have health and safety rules. If a disagreement were to occur, I would probably mediate the two disagreeing parties and talk things through with them, as we recently did between CompSoc and Entrepreneurs Durham -- which eventually led to cooperation between the two societies.
