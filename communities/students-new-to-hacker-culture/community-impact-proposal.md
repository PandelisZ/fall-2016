## Summary of the Community's Needs



- **Community demographics**: Beginning wih CompSoc, which is a rather small community of about 20 people, the ultimate aim is to be able to share the love for technology and encourage the growth of the hacker culture across the entire campus, regardless of educational backgrounds. At the moment, the focus is on encouraging members of CompSoc (the first years, in particular, as they make up the majority of the society and will be taking over leadership from the end of this academic year) to get involved in hackathons. Unfortunately, without the university's support, we lack the resources needed to support their endeavors, and because of Durham's location, getting to hackathons in other locations is difficult; the only thing we can do is to assure them that these events are worth it - which is probably most effectively done by hosting more tech events ourselves.


- **Communication**: Most communication is bilateral between the Exec and the members, done through internal mail systems, and a Facebook page. However, we are trying to encourage more active communication, by introducing the use of Slack.


- **Culture**: As much as we are trying to create an inclusive community, it has been difficult trying to engage our members. At the moment, it is very much a culture where people work on their own individual projects and speak to one another only when they need help, so we are trying to encourage more sociable meetups.




## Your Proposal

Taking advantage of the launch of GGO16 at the start of November, we will use this as our month-long collaborative project to encourage exploratory programming -- the core of the hacker culture.






- **Timing**: We will begin running weekly coding workshops for the student body in Week 5 (due to room booking issues), which will be marketed across the campus to students of all educational backgrounds, to encourage them to try programming. We will begin the idea-generation phase for GGO16 in our CompSoc Meetup at the end of Week 2, and will spend November building the project collaboratively. By Week 6, we will collect the students' ideas and feedback from the program  so that these events can be improved upon, and will then hold Local Hack Day on Dec 3 to implement some of this feedback. At the same time, we can use this opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of the hacker culture to the University, in hopes that they will be more supportive of tech events in the future.


- **Community demographics**: By bridging the gap between CompSoc and the entrepreneurial society, Entrepreneurs Durham, I hope to involve students from business backgrounds in technology, while exposing the technologists to the application of tech in business. Having over a thousand members, Entrepreneurs Durham offers an avenue for marketing and is willing to pool resources with CompSoc in exchange for technical guidance.


- **Goals**: By running regular workshops for the community, we would be equipping them with the skills and confidence that they need to take on exploratory programming on their own. Once they have this confidence, they are more likely to build projects, and would not be put off from taking part in hackathons.


- **Communication**: Having weekly meetups is likely to allow the students to ask us any questions that they may have from a week before. With social media outlets, like Facebook, students are also able to post their questions and have discussions with every member of the society. We are in the process of transitioning to Slack, but, unfortunately, because Slack is unfamiliar to most, we have been struggling to encourage our members to adopt the technology.




## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience: My main focus to begin with would be on the technical community, and should be achievable within the scope of the proposal. It is possible to work on the larger community simultaneously, too, but it will not hold as much priority. However, any longer lasting impact, e.g. inspiring the students enough to want to carry the hacker culture on as a tradition, will take a longer amount of time, and more sustained effort.


- Community needs
: The proposal aims to give students the foundational skills and confidence needed for them to want to pick up exploratory programming, and actively seek out the hacker culture.


- Resources: Although the venue for our events and the equipment required will be covered by the university, we would still require funding to pay for pizza, which would incentivize participation in our tech events. This money can only be acquired through sponsorship. 

- Media: We have already begun discussing and forming the curriculum for the weekly workshops, which would follow a specific "track", balancing CS fundamentals with rapid prototyping (for the non-technical students who may not necessarily see the importance in understanding CS fundamentals). By involving the Exec of CompSoc, as a team, we may be better able to answer any of the questions that the students may have about a specific topic. However, we are considering the feasibility of having lecture-style demonstrations that the students can follow, with multiple technical mentors who can help students struggling with the content.

- Content knowledge
: I am probably underqualified, but am trying my best to help students as much as I can. I am struggling with time management, though; between University commitments, and extracurricular activities, it is incredibly difficult to spend too much time preparing for these events.

- Timeline
: The end of Week 2 is the start of GGO2016, allowing us to add this to the agenda for our weekly CompSoc meetups for the next 4 weeks. Preparation for the coding workshops will begin in Week 3, and the coding workshops themselves will be held 
from Week 5 onwards (due to room booking issues). At the end of Week 5/start of Week 6 is Local Hack Day; after which, we will collect feedback for the past few tech events that we will then reflect upon and integrate into future events.

## Planning for the Future



A hackathon is in the pipeline for January of 2017, and will be the first 24-hour MLH hackathon to be held at Durham University. Hopefully, by the end of January 2017, the hacker culture will flourish in Durham and our students will become more involved in tech events. It would truly be a success if they become inspired, and the hacker culture becomes a tradition at the university, especially amongst the technologists. However, due to time and resource constraints, these activities can only be carried out till the end of Epiphany Term.
