## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics broadly during week 1, and discuss responses in more detail in week 2. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

After you've completed these questions, define your community in several short paragraphs for discussion in week 2.

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
-College students who know how to do rudimentary programming but not build products.
-Budding civictech interest.
-Desire to give back to surrounding community that does not have computer science education infrastructure.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
-Approximately 1,500 members

- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
-An ambitious goal would be to have double the number of members to be 3,000 by the school year 2020. Currently there are a number of undergraduate students interested in computer science and technology that have programming experience -- or don't -- that I feel are not represented in our community. My goal would be to help reach underclassmen with this interest and help foster a community for them where they feel comfortable pursuing their interests and supported by their peers. Currently I feel that the community is largely upper-classmen, who are supportive, but that there's a problem when we only really have declared CS majors and people with experience that it becomes harder for people who are interested in CS enter the group. Additionally, I know UChicago has a at least 2 CS Masters programs that tend to function in tangent to the Undergraduate program; I would love to merge the two communities, as many of the graduate students may not have done CS in their undergrad and would benefit from being a part of our commuity.

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
-Five years ago, CS at UChicago was the 28th most popular major. Now CS is the 8th most popular major. This change came from new job markets being publicized and more people enrolling in CS classes.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
-There are some talks that focus on research and occassional workshops held by random 
-There is a start-up incubator/innovation center very close to campus with its own fab-lab.

- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
-Hack at Uchicago: our general community for all things tech related. There are weekly meetups sometimes sponsored by companies.
-There are talks held by various companies and research done by the school on some Thursdays.
-ACM-W: A student run community for women interested in tech and CS. Meets every other Tuesday evening and holds homework sessions on weeks off.
-FEMMES: A student run CS education outreach organization focused on empowering middle school girls on the South Side of Chicago. Holds weekly Python workshops for a class of 20 girls, and holds annual events in the spring for over 200 attendees. 
-TechTeam: A student organization focused on supporting civic and nonprofit work by providing web and tech services.
-Uncommon Hacks: UChicago held its first MLH hackathon last January and is holding one again January 2017.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
-The resources listed above are all free. 

- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
-Most are held in the evening after working hours.

- Is there childcare available?
-Not to my knowledge.

- Is there accessibility for people with disabilities?
-Very limited accessibility for people with disabilities; it's essentially on the person to contact the organization to prepare for their own disabilities. To provide more accessibility I think a dialogue with office in charge of Student Services would be ideal to see what kind of support is already in place for other communities on campus and seeing how they could be appied to our CS community. 

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
-Our community is made up of a mix of majors; I like it that way.

- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
-Our community is open to everything from theory and research to civictech and hacking.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
-I like to believe its about making a more diverse community. Mostly, it's friends bringing friends to try to include as many people as we can. I would love to see more diverse avenues of tech to help emphasize this point in my community; currently, we have many financial tech. companies, a few major tech. companies, and a few civic tech. company opportunities on campus. I think in particular it'd be interesting to get more companies that deal with art and gaming to engage with our community.

- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
-Yes.

- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
-Yes.

- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
-No, but there is potential.

- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
-I would like to support local hackathon movements and give people the opportunity to learn more about developing/making.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
-We currently only have one or two rooms on campus for the CS events. We also have space at the local incubator but that's scheduled in advance. We also book the computer science labs if they are available.

- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
-It's more of an in-person group actually.

- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
-I do believe there is parking in some places on campus, it is not free though.

- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
-There are various free shuttle services on campus that run for almost the whole day.

- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
-More accessible to those off-campus than on.

- How much does it cost to use the space?
-Unknown

- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
-Rather flexible, we have hosted interview prep, hackathons, corporate talks, and homework nights all in the same place.

- How many people can it fit?
-I believe around 250(?).

- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
-Yes.

- Is there water or snacks available nearby?
-Yes.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
-Facebook events and the various school listhosts.

- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
-There's an email group, and a Facebook group.

- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?
-We would benefit from broadcasting beyond the current infrastructure to engage an audience that may not have subscribed to our channels. In the past I have gone into introductory CS classrooms and general activity fairs and spoke about the various CS events and RSOs on campus. I think a more effective way of retaining interest and engaging with different audiences would be through utilizing existing listhosts that are not CS focused. We could advertize events such as civic hacking at events that are not necessarily CS related but that have attendees who are interested in civic issues. I think there's are a lot of existing avenues that we have not currently reached out to and it's just a matter of getting volunteers to talk.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
-Depends on who you meet and where you go, but I would say that generally the department and the community are rather open to new people and ideas.

- What happens if there is a disagreement?
-N/A. Students generally feel comfortable to report disagreements or incidents to CS faculty or the Title IX coordinator.

- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
-Not to my knowledge. I know that the CS department is good about addressing microaggressions and encouraging an inclusive classroom.

- How will you personally handle it?
-I try to hear both sides of the argument and use an unbiased tone to deliver what I personally believe to be fair. I do not allow sexist or racist beliefs to go by unquestion.
