## Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Definition
- Students at University College London interested in technology and more specifically programming


### Size
- ~600 people are signed up as members, [steadily growing.](http://techsoc.io/graphs/)  
Around 200 of those actively go to events and participate in the community.

- There are 30000 students at UCL. Ideally we want them all to be excited about technology :wink: Realistically we actively encourage students to join our community, but there is no number we are trying to hit. We are in a comfortable position regarding community size. Our focus tends to lie more on making the community more tightly knit than growing it.

- Historically, the community has been slightly smaller. We made it easier this year for newcomers to join by making our membership free and introducing a mentorship programme.

### Resources
- In terms of learning material, we usually refer them to the vast amounts of amazing online resources.
- In terms of what we ourselves offer, at the moment we run a few things:
  - Socials (casual get-togethers)
  - Projects (theme-based, 10 week long opportunities to work on something collaboratively with others)
  - Harvard CS50 (Beginner workshop series in C)
  - Coding & Cookies (Beginner workshop series currently focused on web development)
  - Mentorship Programme (A programme in which more involved members of the community introduce newer members and make them feel welcome)
  - Hackathons
  - Tech Talks (Talks on interesting topics around technology from interesting speakers.)
  - Career opportunities
  - One off-events (such as an introduction to hackathons, an introduction to open source, etc.)
  - and more to come soon!

### Accessibility
- The community is fairly accessible, mostly because all of the members and the committee tend to be very helpful and welcoming.
- Events tend to be in the evening, so most students tend to be free, but some clashes are unavoidable.
- However, there is definitely more that can be done. We cater best to our average member, who tends not to have kids or a disability. As a result we tend not to have any special arrangements in place. We can definitely do more to improve on this.
- This year we have a postgrad representative to help us reach out more and better understand the needs of the postgraduate community.

### Interests
- The community is made up of people who care about technology, who like to build and learn new things.
- A big proportion of the community is Computer Science, but we're becoming more diverse every year. Here is a [graph](http://techsoc.io/graphs/) that gives an indication of how our members are distributed across multiple departments.
- The community tends to be very open to all sorts of interests, as long as there is some sort of relation to technology.

### Goals
- There are quite a few reasons students get involved in the community:
  - They want to meet people that have a common interest
  - They want to learn about a particular technology (for example Virtual Reality)
  - They want to get started with programming
  - They are interested in one of the topics covered by a Tech Talk
  - They are interested in some of the career opportunities the society sponsors offer.


### Location
- The community is very much at home around the [UCL Bloomsbury Campus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+College+London/@51.5245592,-0.1362288,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761b2f69173579:0xd008c67faecc133e!8m2!3d51.5245592!4d-0.1340401)
- We make extensive use of the university's rooms. Those rooms can typically meet our requirements for the number of people that attend our events.
- There are a variety of different rooms and facilities that can accommodate our range of events.
- Because of the central London location, there is:
  - limited/no parking
  - very good public transportation
  - very good access to water and snacks

### Communication
- There are quite a few communication platforms. Mostly communication tends to happen via:
  - The Facebook page and group
  - Our community slack team
  - Our weekly newsletter
  - In person at events!

- We're also present and active on Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Medium, and YouTube


### Culture
- The community tends to be very welcoming to new people and new ideas. It's important to try out things :smile:
- We have a code of conduct and there are various more specific policies surrounding for example posting on the Facebook group.
