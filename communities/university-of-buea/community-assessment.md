## University of Buea

### Definition

  Students at the [University of Buea](http://ubuea.cm/), interested in technology. Both current students and alumni of the University of Buea make up the majority of the [Silicon Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Mountain) community which is known to be Cameroons largest technology hub. Within my community there is a high level of interest in software development and entrepreneurship.

### Size

  The University of Buea consists of about 20000 students, but just about 2500 of this students are enrolled into technology related programs and just about 500 of this students are involved in community activities. The number of persons participating in the community has been improving due to the increase in the number of students who have been participating in the Google Summer of Code each year. It would be good to increase the number of active community members to about 2000.

### Resources
  Some available resource in my community through which people can learn about tech include:
- Internet.
- PL(Programming Lnaguage) meetups. These are free programming language meetups which have been organized by the [Google Developer Group (GDG) Buea](https://www.facebook.com/gdgbuea/) and a local tech startup called [Skademy](https://www.skademy.com/).
- Conferences like the [Silicon Mountain conference](http://www.smconf.org/) have been organized in the past year and also tech events like the Google IO extended.
- Internship opportunities are also provided by local tech startups.

### Accessibility
  Most of the resources are very accessible, but the only issue may be the cost of some resources like Internet and paying for the location where events are held. Meetings are sometimes held when people are working but most of the information is also passed across through mailing lists and online forums so that everyone could be informed of latest updates.No provisions have been made for people with disabilities.

### Interests
  My community consists mostly of computer science and computer engineering students but there are also some few people with different academic background.
 We are open to other topics but we also have some topics which are our focus for the moment like software development and entrepreneurship. 

### Goals
  There is an increase in the number of people getting involved, since they have been motivated by the success of other members of the community and also by the amount of effort that is been put to teach people skills that are essential in the tech community.

  A majority of the people in the community are students hoping to get a degree in computer science or computer engineering.

  My goal for my community would be to increase the number of open-source contributors and also the number  of participants in the Google Summer of Code and I would also like to organize more competitive events like hackerthons in order to increase the number of active community members.

### Location
  For training events we use some classes at our university, but for other events like hackerthons, some alumni of our university who are members of the community voluntarily give out some space at their startup and for events like conference we pay for some larger halls in town, which is really expensive. Depending on the event we can accommodate from 10 â€“ 2000 persons and we always make sure water and snacks are provided at any event.

### Communication
  We mostly use GitHub, online forums, mailing list, Twitter, Facebook, SMS and any other possible means of communication available.

### Culture
  My community is in need for, and open to new people and new ideas.It has always been our desire to invite people from other parts of the world to present talks or workshop during some of our events or conferences. A vote is used to resolve the disagreement but most of the procedures or policies are not officially documented and I would personally handle it through a debate to get more information on why a specific option should be chosen over another.
