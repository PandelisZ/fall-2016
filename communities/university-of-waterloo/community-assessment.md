# University of Waterloo

## Definition 
* Students interested in tech at the University of Waterloo

## Size 
* the university has 35,000 students and I think that approximately 20% of that, 7000 students, are likely in a technology-related program 
* I'd like this number to grow to possibly 8000, because I know of a lot of people who have wanted to switch into a tech-related major or do not even know if they would be a good fit for tech

## Resources 
* since Waterloo is a STEM-focused school and yet, there is not much student-led resources, nor specific resources for those in tech (eg. technical mock interviews, technical panels) 
* a lot of companies come to Waterloo to recruit and they often hold workshops 

## Accessibility
* accessibility for the resources are quite open but the downfall is that people often will not seek them out and there just isn't that much to begin with
 
## Interests 
* Waterloo is msotly an engineering school with a heavy interest in compuster science and software engineering

## Goals
* because Waterloo has a co-op system, many students are studying to get a good co-op job

## Location 
* on Waterloo campus would be the best and most convenient 
* there are many buildings that can accomodate up to thousands of students

## Communication 
* there is a Facebook group for Computer Science within University of Waterloo
* if a Github organization was started, it may help for resource sharing

## Culture 
* not sure how the culture is exactly with new ideas
