My community is mostly made up of college students in the pioneer valley that are a part of the 5 college consortium (Hampshire College, 
UMASS Amherst, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke, and Smith College). These are a mix of public and private schools, with Hampshire and 
Amherst College being private liberal arts colleges. Smith and Mount Holyoke college are private, women's colleges. UMASS Amherst
is a public state school for Massachusettes. So there are students from all over the country attending all of the institutions, but
the majority of students at UMASS are residents of Massacusettes though. There is also a high population of international students,
with the majority coming from Asia.

The community is made up of mostly liberal arts students who do not have much experiece programing. Those that do often took a class in high school.
Some were also a part of extra curicular clubs and programs like Girls WHo Code and ProjectCSGirls. The majority of these 
programs use Java and Python in their lesssons and activities. Traditionally, students will stat off taking Intro to Computer Science 
and a 2 credit seminar course. These courses have the highest percentage of non aspiring cs majors enrolled, with the higher level
computer science courses predomidatly filled with people trying to pursue a degree in CS.
