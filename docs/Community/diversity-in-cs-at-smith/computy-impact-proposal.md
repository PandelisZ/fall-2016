Your Proposal

In this section, articulate the project you want to accomplish during the Campus Experts program; provide a brief summary of what you are planning to accomplish with your project.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:

Timing: You're starting this proposal in Week 2 of the program, and you'll need to execute on your project by Week 6, so you have just about 4 weeks to plan and execute your project. Set the scope appropriately.
Community demographics: If you are planning on increasing the size of the community, identify ways you are planning on accomplishing that. Explain how your efforts might help you create a more diverse community.
Goals: You identified the goals of your community assessment. Include a summary of those goals and how your proposal addresses those goals.
Communication: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community will be able to stay in-contact. This includes in-person meetings, webinars, and chat/forum platforms.
Your Proposal's Impact

I would really like to increase the amount of people who are interested in computer science and are prusing it. I would like to host some kind of pannel that would showcase
tech opportunities in liberal arts fields and how to go about getting these opportunities (application and interview tips). My proposal would include how to organize it and its purpose and execution.
In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish. Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:

Target audience
Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
Students who are already involved in tech and those with an interest in tech, but limited expierience.
Community needs
What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
Students often think that computer science is a field that lacks creativity, and with the majority of students in my community being liberal
arts students, they are all studying a wide ride of disiplines. I want to showcase the intersectionality of technology in these fields.
I also want to provide students with advice on finding and securing these opportunities.
Resources
What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
- Use of a room and technology. 
- Students to sit on the pannel
How will you obtain those resources?
- Through the school's org association.
Media
How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
- Through a powerpoint and pannel.
What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
- Find students who would be able to effectivly sit on the pannel and create the powerpoint.
Content knowledge
How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
Timeline
Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation.
It would only be an overview of the pannelists (at the begining) and the information and links to resources (at the end).

Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

When will you review the impact of your proposal?
I would like to get the attendance list from the pannel and follow up them after the course registration season and application season has ended
and see how many students followed through withan interest in CS.
How will you measure success?
The yield rate of students who attended the session and those who followed through withan interest in tech.
How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
Bi quarterly.
