Answer

```Best practices for writing```

Answer

```How to get ideas on technical writing```

For this question, I  think you can group 'technical writing' into two categories: Software Documentation and Technical Concepts content. My experience as a technical writer focused on developing content for applications that were in development or already released for internal/external use.

From a software documentation standpoint, I typically identified the 'standard' use case of the software and developed an outline of the content that would be most beneficial to the user(s) (EDIT: go into detail about identifying users in @kim-codes question about defining an audience).

On the other hand, creating content that is more conceptual in nature, let's say, using GitHub Pages for Product Documentation, you could identify what delivery methods are currently used by most organizations, describe how GitHub Pages would be used as a delivery method, identify the pros and cons of the various delivery methods ('typical delivery method' vs GitHub Pages), etc.

If you are planning on creating content for Open Source projects or conceptual  content (for a blog or something similar), focus on topics you have are interested in, you are more likely to finish a document if you would benefit or be interested in the final product as a reader.

```How does technical writing differ from any other type of writing ? What should we pay attention to/be mindful of?```

Answer

```How in-depth do we go? Does it depend on our audience? Is that something we should define before (define our audience)?```

When creating software documentation, the team I was on used a 60-30-10 rule to identify what content we should focus on. The breakdown for this rule looked something like this:
- 30: Below Average User - User unfamiliar with using software to complete a specific task. Uncomfortable using a computer for day-to-day activities. Need content that some would identify as incredibly basic / rudimentary. Some examples of content I created for this range included: Identifying how to use a mouse and What a keyboard shortcut was.
- 60: Typical User - Potentially had previous experience using software to complete similar tasks. Comfortable using a computer to complete daily activities. Borderline expert user but still gets hung up on some of the advanced uses of the software (either needs to look at documentation to complete the task or ask a co-worker for assistance). Some examples of content at this level includes: Performing X task (essentially 'out of the box' workflows aka what the user bought to software to accomplish) and similar content.    
- 10: Advanced User - Learns software to complete daily tasks easily. Looks for workarounds or shortcuts to complete tasks. Identified as the 'go-to person' when teammates encounter issues. Potentially creates internal content for their team on how they should be utilizing the software. Some examples of content at this level includes: Administrating your team on <software> and Creating custom workflows.
