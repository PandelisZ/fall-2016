# What's the big deal about Week 8?

Week 8 is the last week of the **training** part of Campus Experts. It's not the end of your time as a Campus Expert, though, it's just the start!

During Week 8, you'll present your community, what you've learnt, and what you've changed or are aiming to change about your community. The presentation will be to your fellow experts and some GitHubbers. 

## Tell me more about this presentation

You should prepare a brief presentation, less than 10 minutes. Here's some tips for content:
- What is your community? Give us a brief intro (2 minutes)
- What are the biggest problems facing your community (2 minutes)
- How do you think they can be solved? (3 minutes)
- What have you done so far towards tackling them, or what are you planning to do? (3 minutes)

Note that this is just a suggested framework, you're free to do it any way you want :) 

## When do I give the presentation?

You should make sure you can make at least one of the calls in week 8 (12th Dec - 18th Dec). If you're unable to make it, please let us know and we'll work it out!

## What happens after week 8?

Our guest speaker for week 7 will be John Britton, Education Liason at GitHub, who will talk more about what to expect next! John will be speaking on Wednesday 7th December, in the EMEA time slot (8am EST, 1pm UK), and as usual it will be recorded.
